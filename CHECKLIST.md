- [ ] Loading spinner visible
- [ ] Input field disabled during generation
- [ ] Waited 30 seconds to 2 minutes
- [ ] Status changed to "Deep Dive is ready!"
- [ ] Initial AI greeting message appeared
- [ ] Input field enabled
- [ ] Send button enabled

### Subsequent Visits (Cached Embeddings)
- [ ] Clicked "Deep Dive" again for same movie
- [ ] Embeddings loaded instantly (no wait)
- [ ] Chat ready immediately
- [ ] No long loading time

### Chat Functionality Test
- [ ] Typed a question in input field
- [ ] Pressed Enter or clicked Send button
- [ ] User message appeared in chat
- [ ] "Thinking..." indicator appeared
- [ ] AI response appeared after 1-3 seconds
- [ ] Response is relevant to the movie
- [ ] Chat auto-scrolled to bottom
- [ ] Can send multiple messages
- [ ] Each message gets a response

### Sample Questions to Test
- [ ] "What is the movie about?"
- [ ] "Who are the main characters?"
- [ ] "What happens at the end?"
- [ ] "Explain [specific scene]"
- [ ] "What is the main theme?"

## üîß Technical Verification Checklist

### API Endpoints
- [ ] GET `/` - Returns API info
- [ ] GET `/docs` - Shows API documentation
- [ ] POST `/summarize` - Works (test separately)
- [ ] POST `/generate_embeddings` - Starts background task
- [ ] GET `/check_embeddings/{movie}` - Returns status
- [ ] WebSocket `/ws/chat/{movie}` - Connects successfully

### WebSocket Connection
- [ ] Open browser DevTools ‚Üí Network ‚Üí WS tab
- [ ] See WebSocket connection when chat is ready
- [ ] Connection status is "Connected"
- [ ] Messages sent and received
- [ ] No connection errors

### Data Persistence
- [ ] Check `backend_fastapi/data/embeddings/` directory
- [ ] `.pkl` files created for tested movies
- [ ] File sizes are 1-5 MB
- [ ] Files persist after server restart
- [ ] Subsequent visits use cached files

### Error Handling
- [ ] Tested with movie that has no subtitles
- [ ] Saw appropriate error message
- [ ] Tested disconnecting backend during chat
- [ ] Saw "Connection lost" message
- [ ] No crashes or unhandled errors

## üìä Performance Checklist

### Timing Benchmarks
- [ ] Embeddings generation: 30s - 2min ‚úì
- [ ] Chat query response: 1-3 seconds ‚úì
- [ ] Status check polling: every 5 seconds ‚úì
- [ ] WebSocket latency: < 100ms ‚úì

### Resource Usage
- [ ] Backend memory usage reasonable (< 2GB)
- [ ] No memory leaks during extended use
- [ ] CPU usage normal during queries
- [ ] Disk space used is reasonable

## üì± UI/UX Checklist

- [ ] Status messages are clear and helpful
- [ ] Chat messages styled distinctly (user vs AI)
- [ ] Colors and contrast are good
- [ ] Buttons have hover effects
- [ ] Disabled states are visible

### User Experience
- [ ] No confusing error messages
- [ ] Clear indication of system state
- [ ] No unexpected behavior
- [ ] Smooth transitions
- [ ] Responsive to user input
- [ ] No lag or stuttering

## üêõ Common Issues Checklist

If something doesn't work, check:

### Backend Issues
- [ ] Is backend running? Check terminal
- [ ] Are all dependencies installed?
- [ ] Are environment variables set correctly?
- [ ] Is port 8000 available?
- [ ] Check backend logs for errors

### Frontend Issues
- [ ] Is frontend running? Check terminal
- [ ] Is NEXT_PUBLIC_FASTAPI_URL correct?
- [ ] Is port 3000 available?
- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Clear browser cache and reload

### WebSocket Issues
- [ ] Is backend running and accessible?
- [ ] Check CORS configuration in main.py
- [ ] Verify WebSocket URL format (ws:// not http://)
- [ ] Check browser console for WebSocket errors
- [ ] Try different browser

### Embeddings Issues
- [ ] Are subtitles available for the movie?
- [ ] Is movie name format correct? "Title (Year)"
- [ ] Check `data/embeddings/` directory permissions
- [ ] Check backend logs during generation
- [ ] Try a different popular movie

## ‚úÖ Final Verification

### System Health
- [ ] Backend: http://localhost:8000/ returns status "ok"
- [ ] Frontend: http://localhost:3000 loads correctly
- [ ] Search works
- [ ] Summarize works (existing feature)
- [ ] Deep Dive works (new feature)
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] No server errors

### Documentation
- [ ] Read README.md
- [ ] Skimmed QUICK_START.md
- [ ] Reviewed FEATURE_SUMMARY.md
- [ ] Know where to find help

### Ready for Use
- [ ] Can search for any movie
- [ ] Can generate embeddings
- [ ] Can chat about movies
- [ ] System is stable
- [ ] Performance is acceptable

## üéâ Success!
