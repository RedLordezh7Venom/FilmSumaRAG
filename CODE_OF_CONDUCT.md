# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of FilmSumaRAG, we pledge to make participation in this project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public channels when an individual is representing the project (e.g., GitHub, issue trackers, mailing lists, chat rooms, and social media).

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the community and the project.
- Showing empathy toward other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form.
- Violent or threatening language and imagery.
- Personal insults, derogatory comments, or exclusionary language.
- Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information (doxing).
- Sustained disruption of community events or discussions.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it as soon as possible.

Preferred reporting options:
- Open a confidential report by creating an issue in this repository with the label "conduct": https://github.com/RedLordezh7Venom/FilmSumaRAG/issues/new?labels=conduct
- If you prefer email or a private report, contact the project lead: RedLordezh7Venom@users.noreply.github.com

When reporting, please include:
- Your contact information and whether you want the report to be treated confidentially.
- The date, time, and location of the incident (links to issues/PRs/threads if applicable).
- Names of the people involved and any witnesses.
- Detailed description of what happened, including screenshots or logs if available.

All reports will be acknowledged and reviewed by maintainers. We aim to respond to reports within 72 hours. Based on the report, maintainers may follow up with questions, request evidence, or take corrective actions. In severe cases, maintainers may escalate to platform administrators.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by this project, including GitHub issues and pull requests, the project wiki, mailing lists, chat channels, and any events organized by the project.
