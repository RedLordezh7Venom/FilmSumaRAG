- Use IMDB API 
- Need to use IMSDB (scrape it )
- fuck it, use selenium headless for scraping subtitles (download srt)\

- SO i found a trick, had to , in subtitle downloading
- subliminal gets subtitles based on name of movie, so I just create a .mp4
- file and then I can process the .srt subtitles

-app.py : 
- replace fetch subtitles, preprocess, and improve summarize
-also delete files after use




- how the production issue was fixed : CORS middleware in the api's origins:
```ORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],  # In production, replace with your actual frontend URL
    allow_credentials=True,
    ```

this had to be set to the name of website/summary page 


- to fix:
skipping encoding issues, FIXED WITH PYSUBS IN UPCOMING MERGE
threading needed for rag or not, anyway boost up rag 
sub download speed is too slow(20s++)FIXED BTW
