- fuck it, use selenium headless for scraping subtitles (download srt)\

- SO i found a trick, had to , in subtitle downloading
- subliminal gets subtitles based on name of movie, so I just create a .mp4
- file and then I can process the .srt subtitles

-app.py : 
- replace fetch subtitles, preprocess, and improve summarize
-also delete files after use
