1
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,463
Yo, Jimmy. Give me the status.
Tell me we good.

2
00:01:13,548 --> 00:01:15,299
- You got it, man.
- Beautiful.

3
00:01:15,757 --> 00:01:18,510
It's gonna be an all-timer tonight.

4
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:25,602
All right, fire them up!

5
00:01:26,144 --> 00:01:27,936
We go live in five!

6
00:01:28,938 --> 00:01:32,150
It's time for ignition
and straight automobile pimping.

7
00:02:03,847 --> 00:02:05,724
- Girl!
- Sorry! My bad!

8
00:02:10,646 --> 00:02:13,191
All right, ladies! We're good.

9
00:02:13,983 --> 00:02:15,318
We're good.

10
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:17,611
That's it, babies.

11
00:02:20,782 --> 00:02:23,241
Come on, Tej!
Let's get this race going!

12
00:02:24,326 --> 00:02:26,037
Wait a second, man.

13
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,872
You cats are first wave.
Where's your fourth at?

14
00:02:28,955 --> 00:02:32,085
It was Joaquin, but he had
to work the graveyard shift.

15
00:02:32,168 --> 00:02:34,545
What? Graveyard shift, man.

16
00:02:35,378 --> 00:02:39,300
- Why don't you run with us, Tej?
- Hell, I'm not running with y'all.

17
00:02:39,634 --> 00:02:43,471
I tell you, either you find a fourth
or you don't race. How about that?

18
00:02:43,554 --> 00:02:47,057
We should find two, so we don't have
to roll with skirt here.

19
00:02:52,562 --> 00:02:54,397
Whoa, wait a second.

20
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:58,527
Why don't I find you a fourth
and we settle this on the streets?

21
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,947
- Bring him on.
- Anybody I want?

22
00:03:01,322 --> 00:03:03,324
No matter who it is?

23
00:03:03,407 --> 00:03:04,574
Yeah.

24
00:03:10,122 --> 00:03:11,206
Yeah?

25
00:03:11,289 --> 00:03:13,209
Yeah, man. You want to race tonight?

26
00:03:13,292 --> 00:03:16,211
I could use the money.
You got four minutes.

27
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,256
I'll be there.

28
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:48,118
The race starts in four minutes.

29
00:03:49,954 --> 00:03:52,038
All right, girls, let's do this.

30
00:04:03,175 --> 00:04:06,012
- You think you'll win, baby?
- What do you think?

31
00:04:06,888 --> 00:04:09,598
- You better. We got rent to pay.
- I know this.

32
00:04:35,249 --> 00:04:37,959
I'll get you when you
get a car worth racing.

33
00:04:47,136 --> 00:04:48,512
There's our fourth.

34
00:04:48,596 --> 00:04:50,305
Shit. It's Brian.

35
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:21,836
- What's up, Tej?
- What's happening, dude?

36
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,964
- Thanks for the invite.
- No problem at all, man.

37
00:05:25,048 --> 00:05:27,550
Just remember me
when you wax, all right?

38
00:05:28,927 --> 00:05:30,553
They got deep pockets?

39
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:32,889
Real deep.

40
00:05:35,433 --> 00:05:37,812
- What's up, Suki?
- What's up, Bullitt?

41
00:05:37,894 --> 00:05:39,646
What do you say we kick it a nickel?

42
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:43,317
Nobody mentioned raising stakes.

43
00:05:49,197 --> 00:05:51,449
If that's the case,
ask these nice people...

44
00:05:51,533 --> 00:05:53,952
to back off the line
so you can go home.

45
00:06:04,963 --> 00:06:07,507
Okay. $3,500.

46
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:18,894
$3,500?

47
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:22,230
Either that
or you can go home, bruh.

48
00:06:27,444 --> 00:06:29,612
It's all there.
Better be.

49
00:06:30,781 --> 00:06:34,367
Damn, Suki, when are you
going to pop my clutch?

50
00:06:34,451 --> 00:06:36,620
As soon as you get
the right set of tools.

51
00:06:36,704 --> 00:06:37,954
All right.

52
00:06:58,182 --> 00:07:00,435
All right, back up. Let's go.

53
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:03,980
Back y'all asses up!

54
00:07:04,064 --> 00:07:06,567
Back up before
you turn into barbecue around here.

55
00:07:06,817 --> 00:07:09,028
It's not a game. This is serious.

56
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,363
All right, back up.
Get off the street. Let's go.

57
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:16,451
Back it up. Everybody keep
your heads real clear, all right?

58
00:07:16,535 --> 00:07:18,786
'Cause I got a surprise
for y'all this evening.

59
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:23,709
Go, Slap Jack! Go, baby!

60
00:07:23,792 --> 00:07:25,293
I got this.

61
00:07:34,845 --> 00:07:36,721
Ready?

62
00:07:40,516 --> 00:07:41,685
Go!

63
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:34,153
Oh, hell, no!

64
00:08:49,168 --> 00:08:51,797
You ain't passing me, dawg. Come on.

65
00:08:54,466 --> 00:08:55,716
What you got?

66
00:09:02,014 --> 00:09:04,017
I told you, you wouldn't pass me!

67
00:09:16,904 --> 00:09:18,157
Move, bitch!

68
00:10:07,246 --> 00:10:08,664
Not tonight, baby!

69
00:10:08,749 --> 00:10:10,667
Bend over, boy.

70
00:10:14,337 --> 00:10:15,589
Damn, girl!

71
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,143
Last turn.

72
00:10:30,854 --> 00:10:31,938
Too wide.

73
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,951
Home stretch, baby.

74
00:10:53,751 --> 00:10:55,128
Got to go, dawg!

75
00:11:14,563 --> 00:11:15,649
Yes!

76
00:11:27,451 --> 00:11:28,495
I can smell you!

77
00:11:28,953 --> 00:11:30,621
Yo, Jimmy, hit it, baby!

78
00:11:36,043 --> 00:11:37,921
All right. Y'all see that?

79
00:11:39,047 --> 00:11:41,006
I told y'all I had a surprise.

80
00:11:41,298 --> 00:11:43,634
How you like that for a finale?

81
00:11:53,102 --> 00:11:54,145
Bridge.

82
00:12:36,187 --> 00:12:37,313
Yeah!

83
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:42,652
Shit!

84
00:12:52,953 --> 00:12:54,456
Oh, hell, no!

85
00:12:59,628 --> 00:13:01,046
Smack that ass!

86
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:26,613
Yes!

87
00:13:35,788 --> 00:13:38,750
I saw that, man.
Bullitt and Suki sprayed the bridge.

88
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:41,753
I need to start making
y'all pay to see this shit.

89
00:13:41,836 --> 00:13:44,588
I got over $10,000
for my man here, all right?

90
00:13:44,923 --> 00:13:47,841
That's what I'm talking about, man.
Play with it.

91
00:13:48,426 --> 00:13:50,803
- Smells good, don't it?
- How about that?

92
00:13:50,886 --> 00:13:53,389
Right. Y'all see this?
Everybody take a good look.

93
00:13:53,472 --> 00:13:56,768
This is what you call mutual
respect. All right, let's clear out.

94
00:13:57,601 --> 00:13:59,604
Anybody down for another race?

95
00:14:00,897 --> 00:14:01,940
Shit.

96
00:14:06,277 --> 00:14:08,989
Make sure you bring that body
by the garage later...

97
00:14:09,072 --> 00:14:12,575
so we can work
on that front end of yours.

98
00:14:13,743 --> 00:14:14,869
Watch out.

99
00:14:15,995 --> 00:14:17,496
Maybe I will.

100
00:14:25,212 --> 00:14:26,755
Where are you going?

101
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:30,051
- Time to get out of here.
- Why is that?

102
00:15:04,085 --> 00:15:05,794
Nissan Skyline! Got him!

103
00:15:16,096 --> 00:15:17,682
Shit!

104
00:15:41,163 --> 00:15:42,331
Damn!

105
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,549
Let me see your hands!
Put them up!

106
00:15:53,634 --> 00:15:55,345
Yeah, this is him.
We got him.

107
00:16:06,522 --> 00:16:10,567
So, how long
you been in South Florida?

108
00:16:10,652 --> 00:16:12,570
A while.
Before that?

109
00:16:15,865 --> 00:16:18,951
We know you're Brian O'Conner,
formerly of the LAPD.

110
00:16:19,826 --> 00:16:21,913
- You got the wrong guy.
- Really?

111
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,628
How you doing, O'Conner?

112
00:16:31,923 --> 00:16:33,383
Let's take a walk.

113
00:16:36,302 --> 00:16:37,552
Carter Verone.

114
00:16:38,011 --> 00:16:41,224
Born in Argentina, but he's lived
most of his life in Miami.

115
00:16:41,724 --> 00:16:44,811
Now he owns the biggest
import-export business in the state.

116
00:16:44,894 --> 00:16:48,648
Unfortunately, the cartels have been
successful getting drugs into Miami.

117
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:51,192
But they've had a hard time
getting the cash out.

118
00:16:51,275 --> 00:16:53,068
We've surveilled him for a year.

119
00:16:53,152 --> 00:16:55,863
But we haven't been able to put him
and the money together.

120
00:16:55,947 --> 00:16:58,658
- We've swept his house, warehouses-
- Nothing.

121
00:16:59,116 --> 00:17:02,035
Customs here has done a great job
of getting us this far.

122
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,163
I'm here to help get them
over the top.

123
00:17:04,247 --> 00:17:06,540
I was able to get
an agent in undercover...

124
00:17:06,624 --> 00:17:08,875
working travel and
logistics for him.

125
00:17:09,001 --> 00:17:11,628
Verone's put her in charge
of finding new drivers.

126
00:17:11,712 --> 00:17:15,173
Right, although we can't confirm
her status right now.

127
00:17:15,549 --> 00:17:19,136
- You think she's flipped?
- She's one of mine. She's all right.

128
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:23,307
She's been in with Verone a year.
Even lives at the compound with him.

129
00:17:23,391 --> 00:17:27,519
Look, it was the FBI's idea
to bring you in. I'm against it.

130
00:17:27,811 --> 00:17:31,691
But we need good drivers to put
this asshole and his money together.

131
00:17:31,982 --> 00:17:34,152
You're gonna roll with Agent Dunn.

132
00:17:34,693 --> 00:17:35,987
And if I don't?

133
00:17:36,445 --> 00:17:39,115
Here's a list of the laws
you broke in L.A.

134
00:17:39,531 --> 00:17:42,910
Obstruction of justice, aiding and
abetting. You know the rap sheet.

135
00:17:42,993 --> 00:17:46,580
We can make this all go away
in the interest of justice...

136
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,500
if you're willing to play ball.

137
00:17:52,627 --> 00:17:56,590
What's the idea here? Dunn and I
are supposed to be street racers?

138
00:17:56,715 --> 00:17:58,009
That's right.

139
00:18:04,097 --> 00:18:05,307
So, Dunn...

140
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,563
looks like we're
going to be partners, bro.

141
00:18:10,645 --> 00:18:12,522
Tell me, what would be
a better motor...

142
00:18:12,606 --> 00:18:15,192
for my Skyline,
a Gallo 12 or a Gallo 24?

143
00:18:20,573 --> 00:18:21,824
Twenty four.

144
00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:25,286
I didn't know
pizza places made motors.

145
00:18:28,122 --> 00:18:30,415
See, man, come on, I can't do this.

146
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:34,961
If this is what you'll give me,
I'll take my chances in Chino.

147
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,839
We'll get someone else.

148
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,300
No way, man.

149
00:18:42,345 --> 00:18:45,640
The only way I'll do this is
if I get to pick the driver.

150
00:18:47,182 --> 00:18:49,852
All right, O'Conner.
Who you got in mind?

151
00:18:50,435 --> 00:18:53,772
- A dude I grew up with in Barstow.
- Who's that?

152
00:18:54,815 --> 00:18:56,107
Roman Pearce.

153
00:19:20,674 --> 00:19:23,385
That him in the Monte Carlo?
That's him.

154
00:19:25,011 --> 00:19:26,888
He's got some skills.

155
00:19:27,222 --> 00:19:29,724
And he's crazy as hell,
I'm telling you.

156
00:19:30,768 --> 00:19:33,186
In a good way, though.
He's the man for the job.

157
00:19:38,358 --> 00:19:41,653
And he has quite a record,
including three years upstate.

158
00:19:42,113 --> 00:19:44,115
Says here,
he's on house arrest now.

159
00:19:44,198 --> 00:19:46,784
Can't go more than
100 yards from his home.

160
00:20:25,071 --> 00:20:27,032
He always said he'd be famous.

161
00:20:31,494 --> 00:20:32,747
Pearce!

162
00:20:33,998 --> 00:20:35,374
Roman Pearce!

163
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,336
Whatever happens next,
just let it go.

164
00:20:39,586 --> 00:20:40,837
I ain't in it.

165
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,259
Rome!

166
00:20:51,432 --> 00:20:53,851
Only my homeboys call me Rome...

167
00:20:54,351 --> 00:20:55,478
pig.

168
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:02,401
- I'm not a cop anymore.
- Is that true?

169
00:21:04,528 --> 00:21:06,196
Blondie here is not a cop anymore?

170
00:21:06,238 --> 00:21:08,574
That's true. No badge.

171
00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:22,046
Here we go.

172
00:21:33,057 --> 00:21:36,018
You still fight like shit.

173
00:21:37,185 --> 00:21:39,020
You better chill.

174
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,398
- Why are you here?
- I'll choke you.

175
00:21:42,482 --> 00:21:44,609
I told you to stay away from me.

176
00:21:48,864 --> 00:21:51,909
You should have told me.
I did three years, Brian.

177
00:21:51,991 --> 00:21:53,701
I told you it wasn't my fault.

178
00:22:03,753 --> 00:22:05,548
Why did you come here?

179
00:22:09,634 --> 00:22:11,303
I got a deal for you.

180
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:18,184
When I needed your ass,
you were nowhere to be found.

181
00:22:19,894 --> 00:22:22,146
Now you're trying to hand out deals?

182
00:22:25,401 --> 00:22:27,611
I need you to come to Miami
and drive with me.

183
00:22:27,694 --> 00:22:30,990
If you do, they'll take off
that anklet and clear your record.

184
00:22:31,073 --> 00:22:33,200
I did three years in jail.

185
00:22:34,076 --> 00:22:35,994
Three years over you, Brian.

186
00:22:36,996 --> 00:22:39,832
- I know you better than you think.
- Maybe you don't.

187
00:22:39,914 --> 00:22:41,458
Maybe you don't.

188
00:22:42,334 --> 00:22:43,876
You guys finished?

189
00:22:44,752 --> 00:22:46,422
Is this deal legit?

190
00:22:47,006 --> 00:22:49,508
That's right.
If you do this job for us.

191
00:22:49,842 --> 00:22:52,094
- I told you.
- Shut up, punk.

192
00:22:53,886 --> 00:22:57,682
So you'll clean my record
and get this thing off my ankle.

193
00:22:57,766 --> 00:22:59,058
That's right.

194
00:22:59,643 --> 00:23:02,938
I thought you couldn't wander
more than 100 yards from your home.

195
00:23:03,021 --> 00:23:05,606
Why do you think
I'm parked so close to the derby?

196
00:23:05,691 --> 00:23:08,027
Quit playing
like you'll pass this up.

197
00:23:09,653 --> 00:23:11,195
You stupid...

198
00:23:40,808 --> 00:23:42,144
Wait. Hold on.

199
00:23:44,563 --> 00:23:46,230
Bro, what's going on?

200
00:23:46,898 --> 00:23:49,567
I don't know if
I should be trusting you, man.

201
00:23:52,653 --> 00:23:56,741
Think of it this way. It's a chance
for a fresh start. Let's do this.

202
00:23:56,825 --> 00:23:59,869
I wouldn't need a fresh start
if it wasn't for you.

203
00:24:00,203 --> 00:24:02,455
You've been using that
since you got busted.

204
00:24:02,538 --> 00:24:05,917
- Let's just chill out and do this.
- I don't need to chill out.

205
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,296
Yes, you do. And you need to stop
blaming me for your mistakes.

206
00:24:09,378 --> 00:24:12,673
Roman Pearce needs to start taking
responsibility for his actions.

207
00:24:12,758 --> 00:24:16,303
- You need to go to hell.
- You need to go back to Barstow.

208
00:24:19,013 --> 00:24:21,349
I'm not going back
to Barstow.

209
00:24:31,984 --> 00:24:35,404
Brian O'Conner,
Roman Pearce, meet Monica Fuentes.

210
00:24:35,489 --> 00:24:38,241
- They have background on Verone?
- They've been briefed.

211
00:24:38,325 --> 00:24:40,618
Good.
All right, here's the deal.

212
00:24:40,701 --> 00:24:43,788
Verone's looking for drivers.
I arranged for you two to join.

213
00:24:43,872 --> 00:24:46,165
I also hired some thugs
to make it legit.

214
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,417
- When do we start?
- Right now.

215
00:24:48,876 --> 00:24:50,420
What are we driving?

216
00:24:57,719 --> 00:25:00,638
Don't even think about
taking the convertible.

217
00:25:00,721 --> 00:25:02,682
It might loosen your mousse.

218
00:25:02,932 --> 00:25:05,644
That's cool.
Too much chrome for me anyways.

219
00:25:05,727 --> 00:25:10,356
Damn! Where do you all
confiscate these rims from, man?

220
00:25:10,982 --> 00:25:13,234
Check in with us after you meet him.

221
00:25:14,819 --> 00:25:17,865
- You okay with these knuckleheads?
- I can handle them.

222
00:25:17,948 --> 00:25:20,992
- If they trouble you, let me know.
- Thanks, Markham.

223
00:25:24,413 --> 00:25:26,080
I ride with you, cowboy.

224
00:25:26,748 --> 00:25:28,291
Why she gotta ride with you?

225
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:30,544
You get the convertible.
Let's go.

226
00:25:45,057 --> 00:25:46,434
Turn right here.

227
00:25:51,022 --> 00:25:53,608
- So, you used to be a cop?
- Yeah.

228
00:25:55,277 --> 00:25:57,028
How long you been under?

229
00:25:57,863 --> 00:25:59,197
I lost track.

230
00:26:00,031 --> 00:26:01,282
You all right?

231
00:26:03,326 --> 00:26:06,454
You might want to keep
your eyes on the road, playboy.

232
00:26:06,829 --> 00:26:09,833
- You think we're gonna crash?
- I haven't decided yet.

233
00:26:14,671 --> 00:26:16,506
What are you doing, Brian?

234
00:26:26,223 --> 00:26:29,769
He did the "stare and drive" on you,
didn't he? He got that from me.

235
00:27:05,137 --> 00:27:07,473
Once we get in here,
you're on your own.

236
00:27:19,361 --> 00:27:20,778
Look at that one.

237
00:27:21,195 --> 00:27:24,490
Where'd you get them cars?
At the bottom of a cereal box?

238
00:27:26,701 --> 00:27:28,744
Real funny, Fonzie.

239
00:27:30,163 --> 00:27:31,330
Ass.

240
00:27:31,539 --> 00:27:34,291
Roberto, Enrique,
I need pictures of the drivers...

241
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:37,211
their license plates, cars,
and anything else you can find.

242
00:27:50,267 --> 00:27:51,601
Let's go.

243
00:27:54,604 --> 00:27:57,356
Keep your mouth shut
and follow my lead, all right?

244
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,442
- I got this.
- No, I'm serious.

245
00:28:01,819 --> 00:28:04,196
Handle your business.
I'll handle mine.

246
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:09,702
Watch your hands, bruh.

247
00:28:12,747 --> 00:28:14,082
Go in line.

248
00:28:14,164 --> 00:28:15,625
Let's go.

249
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,969
Carter.

250
00:28:33,518 --> 00:28:35,436
The drivers are here.
Good.

251
00:28:35,769 --> 00:28:36,938
Come on.

252
00:28:41,233 --> 00:28:42,318
Stay.

253
00:28:44,653 --> 00:28:46,698
What's going on here?
Tell me.

254
00:28:47,699 --> 00:28:50,242
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

255
00:28:51,661 --> 00:28:53,788
My red Ferrari was confiscated.

256
00:28:53,872 --> 00:28:56,415
It sits in an impound lot
in Little Haiti.

257
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,792
It's about 20 miles from here.

258
00:28:59,085 --> 00:29:03,213
The car isn't important. The package
I left in the glove box is.

259
00:29:03,298 --> 00:29:05,717
The first team back here
with the package...

260
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:07,885
will have an opportunity
to work for me.

261
00:29:07,969 --> 00:29:10,137
What are you saying?
We got to audition?

262
00:29:10,305 --> 00:29:12,348
Nobody has a gun to your head.

263
00:29:14,768 --> 00:29:16,102
That's it.

264
00:29:17,019 --> 00:29:19,439
Driver's licenses. Pass them up.

265
00:29:21,357 --> 00:29:22,692
Before Christmas, guys.

266
00:29:26,237 --> 00:29:27,571
Let's go!

267
00:29:47,342 --> 00:29:48,593
Come on, cuz!

268
00:29:51,846 --> 00:29:53,681
Let's see what this thing can do.

269
00:30:10,365 --> 00:30:12,991
Agent Markham.
They're heading south on I-95.

270
00:30:13,076 --> 00:30:14,411
I got it.

271
00:30:15,036 --> 00:30:17,247
They're running. What a surprise.

272
00:30:27,923 --> 00:30:29,467
Stick with me, Rome.

273
00:30:38,393 --> 00:30:40,144
Why must I chase the cat?

274
00:30:54,491 --> 00:30:55,742
Smart-ass.

275
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:05,502
You think you're the bomb, Rome?

276
00:31:44,541 --> 00:31:46,711
Let's see if you still got it.

277
00:31:48,671 --> 00:31:50,673
I got something for your ass.

278
00:31:57,055 --> 00:31:58,388
Watch this, bro.

279
00:32:07,356 --> 00:32:08,523
Shit.

280
00:32:09,567 --> 00:32:11,736
How do you like them apples?

281
00:32:11,986 --> 00:32:13,237
Show-off!

282
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:16,782
That's the Brian O'Conner
school of driving, baby!

283
00:32:21,412 --> 00:32:23,122
Crazy-ass white boy!

284
00:32:24,164 --> 00:32:25,333
Shit!

285
00:32:54,237 --> 00:32:55,863
Bumbaclot.

286
00:32:57,906 --> 00:33:00,034
You better get out
of the street!

287
00:33:00,117 --> 00:33:01,786
That's some bad shit.

288
00:33:11,461 --> 00:33:12,755
What do we got?

289
00:33:15,967 --> 00:33:17,718
That's good. Show me his partner.

290
00:33:21,806 --> 00:33:23,307
Where are the cars?

291
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:31,898
Stinking boats. Where are the cars?

292
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,828
I need the cars.
Where are the cars at?

293
00:34:15,233 --> 00:34:17,235
Look in the centre.
What?

294
00:34:19,905 --> 00:34:21,072
Cha-ching!

295
00:34:21,407 --> 00:34:23,701
- Now put your blouse back on.
- Hater.

296
00:34:32,751 --> 00:34:33,920
Shit!

297
00:34:38,382 --> 00:34:40,259
- Don't let him get away.
- Not a problem.

298
00:34:40,342 --> 00:34:42,552
Sit on it, Fonzie!

299
00:34:43,762 --> 00:34:45,056
What the hell?

300
00:34:45,472 --> 00:34:46,681
Shit. Cops.

301
00:34:47,391 --> 00:34:48,684
What are they doing here?

302
00:34:48,726 --> 00:34:50,478
Rome, no!

303
00:34:53,688 --> 00:34:55,273
Time to go.

304
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:00,737
Son of a bitch!

305
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:03,990
Juvy record
for popping cars. Two years in J.D.

306
00:35:04,074 --> 00:35:06,869
Another year for aiding and abetting
an armed robbery.

307
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,956
He's clean. Dirty, but clean.

308
00:35:11,873 --> 00:35:12,958
All right.

309
00:35:33,646 --> 00:35:36,815
Hey, man. You got something
to eat up in there?

310
00:35:37,608 --> 00:35:38,983
We hungry.

311
00:35:42,905 --> 00:35:44,782
Sit them by the pool.

312
00:35:45,574 --> 00:35:47,117
Nice. Come on.

313
00:35:56,335 --> 00:35:59,880
- What are you checking her out for?
- I'm not checking her out.

314
00:36:03,967 --> 00:36:06,262
- Yes, you were.
- No, I wasn't.

315
00:36:07,054 --> 00:36:10,682
- I seen you checking her out.
- Okay, I was. Now shut up.

316
00:36:10,766 --> 00:36:13,268
You shut up.
Don't tell me to shut up.

317
00:36:13,351 --> 00:36:16,563
Both you girlies shut up.
Unbelievable.

318
00:36:27,992 --> 00:36:30,911
You sure are cosy
in this big old mansion.

319
00:36:33,329 --> 00:36:35,373
Sleeping with the enemy.

320
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,630
No, no. Sit down.

321
00:36:43,965 --> 00:36:46,302
Nice Ferrari you got
in the driveway.

322
00:36:48,471 --> 00:36:50,347
I'm glad you like it.

323
00:36:54,893 --> 00:36:56,769
Darling, will you hold that?

324
00:37:05,362 --> 00:37:07,655
We did all that for a damn cigar?

325
00:37:08,157 --> 00:37:10,492
No. You did that for a job.

326
00:37:17,248 --> 00:37:21,085
Do you really think that
I would let somebody impound my car?

327
00:37:25,298 --> 00:37:27,009
The boatyard is mine.

328
00:37:27,927 --> 00:37:30,262
By the way, you two owe me a gate.

329
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:32,514
I'll take it off your cut.

330
00:37:35,351 --> 00:37:37,143
- Off our cut?
- Yeah.

331
00:37:38,646 --> 00:37:40,438
I like that.
Good.

332
00:37:40,898 --> 00:37:43,317
What's this job
you got for us, anyway?

333
00:37:43,442 --> 00:37:44,610
Come with me.

334
00:37:44,693 --> 00:37:46,527
The house has ears in it.

335
00:37:48,655 --> 00:37:52,534
I have something I want you to carry
from North Beach to the Keys.

336
00:37:52,617 --> 00:37:53,827
What is it?

337
00:37:53,911 --> 00:37:55,871
Just put it in the car,
drive it to me...

338
00:37:55,913 --> 00:37:58,706
and don't let anybody
stop you. Understand?

339
00:37:59,123 --> 00:38:00,708
Any chance of cop trouble?

340
00:38:00,793 --> 00:38:04,630
I'm buying you a window of time,
but it won't be open very long.

341
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:08,132
You make it...

342
00:38:09,342 --> 00:38:12,637
and I'll personally hand you
$100,000 at the finish line.

343
00:38:13,137 --> 00:38:15,474
Make it $100,000 apiece.

344
00:38:17,726 --> 00:38:19,186
Look, man...

345
00:38:20,019 --> 00:38:21,480
obviously...

346
00:38:22,898 --> 00:38:24,775
your pockets ain't nervous.

347
00:38:25,985 --> 00:38:28,403
- Don't ever touch me.
- Ours are empty.

348
00:38:30,114 --> 00:38:31,657
Like I said...

349
00:38:32,449 --> 00:38:33,826
we hungry.

350
00:38:43,793 --> 00:38:48,257
I got an idea. Why don't you boys
join us at the club later tonight?

351
00:38:48,465 --> 00:38:50,342
Yeah. Pearl at midnight?

352
00:38:50,425 --> 00:38:53,387
- Get to know each other better.
- Sounds good.

353
00:38:55,012 --> 00:38:57,056
See you tonight.
See you.

354
00:39:00,811 --> 00:39:02,146
Hey, you!

355
00:39:04,898 --> 00:39:07,818
- Your pockets aren't empty.
- Damn.

356
00:39:08,443 --> 00:39:10,320
I'll take my cutter back.

357
00:39:17,161 --> 00:39:18,579
Stupid ass.

358
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:23,751
Hey, man, I figured you
had 12 or 13 of these.

359
00:39:23,833 --> 00:39:26,210
You're not too bright.
Get out of here.

360
00:39:27,128 --> 00:39:30,382
- You're doing the same stupid shit.
- Get off me.

361
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:34,469
Look, running your mouth?
Insulting people? Stealing his shit?

362
00:39:34,844 --> 00:39:37,264
You think I'd let someone
stare me down?

363
00:39:37,347 --> 00:39:40,099
I didn't let nobody
stare me down in jail, homeboy.

364
00:39:40,184 --> 00:39:42,728
You think I'm gonna
let it fly on a beach?

365
00:39:43,436 --> 00:39:46,063
"And you, I'll take my cutter back. "

366
00:39:46,398 --> 00:39:47,900
His rich ass.

367
00:39:48,608 --> 00:39:51,235
- And you're packing.
- Like you ain't.

368
00:39:53,655 --> 00:39:54,947
Exactly.

369
00:39:55,114 --> 00:39:58,869
- From here on, I do the talking.
- You want to do more than that.

370
00:39:58,952 --> 00:40:00,369
What does that mean?

371
00:40:00,454 --> 00:40:04,248
It means you always get in trouble
over a female, Brian.

372
00:40:15,844 --> 00:40:18,679
Tej's garage is ridiculous.
He has everything.

373
00:40:18,764 --> 00:40:23,059
Snap-on tools. These lifts are new.
They're only a couple of months old.

374
00:40:23,143 --> 00:40:25,978
- Jimmy. What's up, man?
- What's up, Bullitt?

375
00:40:26,063 --> 00:40:27,940
That's Rome there. Do me a favour.

376
00:40:28,023 --> 00:40:31,652
When you get a second, I want you
to check out the Evo and Spyder.

377
00:40:31,735 --> 00:40:33,653
Where'd you get an Evo from?

378
00:40:33,737 --> 00:40:35,989
- It's a long story.
- I got you, man.

379
00:40:36,072 --> 00:40:37,615
Thanks, Jimmy.

380
00:40:37,907 --> 00:40:40,911
It's so hot and humid,
I can't even wear drawers.

381
00:40:40,994 --> 00:40:42,704
Tell me about it.

382
00:40:43,454 --> 00:40:45,873
Look at all this potential out here.

383
00:40:45,958 --> 00:40:49,253
Ray, don't do that, man.
You're making me lose money.

384
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:53,382
Come on, stop that.
I know you're better than that.

385
00:40:55,132 --> 00:40:56,300
Damn.

386
00:41:08,563 --> 00:41:12,317
Your boy can help put that fire out!
Look at the bubble-

387
00:41:13,485 --> 00:41:14,987
Let's go.
Serious.

388
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,905
Ray, you're making me
lose money.

389
00:41:16,989 --> 00:41:19,574
Don't do that.
Don't do that to me, now.

390
00:41:19,657 --> 00:41:21,201
Come on, Ray. Do it.

391
00:41:21,867 --> 00:41:25,038
Tej Parker? This is Roman Pearce.

392
00:41:27,289 --> 00:41:31,585
Basically, he's the man to know in
Miami. Has his finger in everything.

393
00:41:31,753 --> 00:41:33,672
It's just the way it is.

394
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,715
- What's going on?
- What's up?

395
00:41:35,798 --> 00:41:37,300
- How you doing?
- Good.

396
00:41:37,384 --> 00:41:39,135
What's this?
What's the latest?

397
00:41:40,846 --> 00:41:43,264
It's a work in progress.
It's not finished.

398
00:41:43,347 --> 00:41:46,101
That's some artistic shit.
You got talent.

399
00:41:46,184 --> 00:41:49,813
Ray, it's do or die now!
Bring it home, Ray!

400
00:41:51,063 --> 00:41:52,481
Yeah, baby!

401
00:41:52,773 --> 00:41:54,443
Pay up! Pay up!

402
00:41:55,902 --> 00:41:57,695
That's how they do it out here?

403
00:41:57,778 --> 00:41:59,947
- Every day.
- That's crazy.

404
00:42:00,032 --> 00:42:03,284
Right here. Right now.
You don't look too happy.

405
00:42:03,702 --> 00:42:07,831
Expeditiously, man. I need it quick.
Thank you. Thank you.

406
00:42:08,123 --> 00:42:11,960
How you feeling, man?
You all right? Thank you.

407
00:42:13,586 --> 00:42:15,045
Not too bad.

408
00:42:17,257 --> 00:42:20,719
I see you're about your money,
homey. You race, too?

409
00:42:22,262 --> 00:42:26,432
No, man. I hit a wall doing
like a buck 20 a couple years ago.

410
00:42:26,724 --> 00:42:29,643
Ever since then, I've just been
organising and collecting.

411
00:42:29,728 --> 00:42:33,606
Check it out. He'll be in town
a while. Can he use that cot?

412
00:42:35,065 --> 00:42:37,152
What's wrong with your place?

413
00:42:38,277 --> 00:42:41,280
I don't want to stay with him.
He has bad habits.

414
00:42:42,865 --> 00:42:46,661
All right. Show him around.
I'll be up there in a minute.

415
00:42:46,744 --> 00:42:48,079
- Thanks.
- Sure.

416
00:42:49,289 --> 00:42:51,875
Who wants a chance
to win their money back?

417
00:42:52,708 --> 00:42:56,003
So, Jimmy? You ever seen
anything like this before?

418
00:42:56,213 --> 00:42:59,590
No. Both of them
are wired like I never seen before.

419
00:42:59,673 --> 00:43:00,842
What?

420
00:43:00,925 --> 00:43:02,719
They got us wired with GPS.

421
00:43:02,802 --> 00:43:05,847
That's why Markham knew
we were at that impound lot.

422
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:10,184
You the master mechanic.
Can't you just yank that shit out?

423
00:43:10,434 --> 00:43:12,728
I'll try, but this ain't LoJack.

424
00:43:12,853 --> 00:43:16,815
The DIS box, the engine management
system, the main harness...

425
00:43:16,983 --> 00:43:18,902
The GPS is spidered into all that.

426
00:43:18,985 --> 00:43:20,528
Tell me something, man.

427
00:43:20,653 --> 00:43:23,114
Do I even want to know
where the Skyline is, dawg?

428
00:43:23,197 --> 00:43:26,952
Or where you've been or where
the hell you got these rides from?

429
00:43:27,619 --> 00:43:29,621
- They're hot.
- Yeah, they hot.

430
00:43:29,704 --> 00:43:33,833
Wired so hot, anyone tracking them
knows if you wear your seat belt.

431
00:43:37,003 --> 00:43:38,338
All right, Jimmy.

432
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:40,882
- Just do what you can do, bro.
- I got you.

433
00:43:40,965 --> 00:43:42,300
Thanks, man.

434
00:43:42,467 --> 00:43:45,052
We need to get these
on the street ASAP.

435
00:43:46,262 --> 00:43:47,764
Check it out.

436
00:43:48,056 --> 00:43:50,684
See that Cadillac across the street?

437
00:43:55,521 --> 00:43:58,400
They've been on us
since we left Verone's house.

438
00:44:08,284 --> 00:44:11,621
Elian and Fidel!

439
00:44:12,789 --> 00:44:14,748
Can I clean your windshield?

440
00:44:14,833 --> 00:44:16,668
What are you doing, man?

441
00:44:19,295 --> 00:44:20,838
Is everything copastetic?

442
00:44:22,798 --> 00:44:24,467
Kiss my ass.

443
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:27,177
Shit.

444
00:44:30,097 --> 00:44:31,432
Let's go!

445
00:44:37,146 --> 00:44:39,940
He'll blow our cover
before we even get started.

446
00:44:40,275 --> 00:44:43,527
- What went wrong?
- That's what I want to know.

447
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:45,739
Show me your hands.
Keep them up!

448
00:44:45,822 --> 00:44:47,949
- What's this about?
- What's going on?

449
00:44:48,032 --> 00:44:51,411
Hold this. You think you can
shoot at me? I'm a federal agent.

450
00:44:51,494 --> 00:44:52,619
What are you talking about?

451
00:44:52,704 --> 00:44:55,706
Get your damn hands off me!
Get him away from me, dawg!

452
00:44:55,789 --> 00:44:58,960
'Cause you wear a badge doesn't mean
you can mess shit up for us!

453
00:44:59,043 --> 00:45:00,753
Get your hands off me!

454
00:45:00,836 --> 00:45:02,963
- Lucky I didn't shoot you!
- Shut up!

455
00:45:03,047 --> 00:45:04,715
Don't tell me to shut up!

456
00:45:04,798 --> 00:45:07,135
You almost blew our cover, old man!

457
00:45:07,217 --> 00:45:09,262
You shouldn't have shown up
like you did.

458
00:45:09,344 --> 00:45:11,347
You didn't know
Verone was testing us?

459
00:45:11,431 --> 00:45:13,557
I thought you punks were running!

460
00:45:13,641 --> 00:45:15,934
That's great. That's real great!

461
00:45:16,018 --> 00:45:19,856
And if Rome wanted to shoot you?
You wouldn't be here right now.

462
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,733
We got to get this under control.

463
00:45:27,697 --> 00:45:29,157
That's mine!

464
00:45:29,324 --> 00:45:30,492
So?

465
00:45:31,451 --> 00:45:35,079
- Tell me what you know.
- We're making a run for Verone.

466
00:45:35,163 --> 00:45:36,998
I'm not sure when or where...

467
00:45:37,081 --> 00:45:40,501
but he said he bought us a window,
I assume from the local cops.

468
00:45:40,585 --> 00:45:43,086
I can talk to some guys
at the local P.D.

469
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:46,257
No good. If Verone has some
of them on payroll...

470
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:48,592
we can't let
them know our operation.

471
00:45:48,675 --> 00:45:49,969
Exactly.

472
00:45:50,344 --> 00:45:54,474
In addition, Verone told us that
he himself will be at the drop.

473
00:45:54,641 --> 00:45:56,351
That's good news.

474
00:45:56,684 --> 00:46:00,480
If you're delivering drug money,
we can get him for laundering.

475
00:46:00,646 --> 00:46:02,981
- Now, there's only one problem.
- What's that?

476
00:46:03,065 --> 00:46:04,358
Fuentes.

477
00:46:04,692 --> 00:46:06,860
- Verone's tapping her.
- Tapping her?

478
00:46:07,195 --> 00:46:09,280
- Tapping her how?
- That is crap.

479
00:46:09,364 --> 00:46:11,740
What you talking about?
We know what we seen.

480
00:46:11,824 --> 00:46:15,954
What do you think, O'Conner?
She's compromised? You should know.

481
00:46:16,371 --> 00:46:19,748
- What does that mean?
- Your pal O'Conner didn't tell you?

482
00:46:19,833 --> 00:46:21,876
He flipped on Bilkins in L.A.

483
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,878
He gave his mark his car keys
and let him disappear.

484
00:46:24,963 --> 00:46:27,297
That's why he's not a cop anymore.

485
00:46:29,425 --> 00:46:31,719
So what do you think, expert?

486
00:46:32,971 --> 00:46:34,222
I don't know.

487
00:46:34,304 --> 00:46:36,641
All right. We'll keep an eye on her.

488
00:46:38,141 --> 00:46:39,893
We're out of here.

489
00:46:46,693 --> 00:46:48,360
Let your man go?

490
00:46:48,902 --> 00:46:50,737
Drop it.
I don't wanna talk about it.

491
00:46:50,822 --> 00:46:53,699
Drop it, hell.
I want to hear about this, homey.

492
00:46:53,949 --> 00:46:55,784
Forget about it, cuz.

493
00:46:55,867 --> 00:46:57,996
We got Fuentes in with Verone...

494
00:46:58,788 --> 00:47:00,748
Markham trying to blow our cover...

495
00:47:00,831 --> 00:47:04,918
and we got two wired cars no better
than that ankle bracelet of mine.

496
00:47:05,003 --> 00:47:09,132
I'll tell you, bruh, you let Markham
do that again in front of Verone...

497
00:47:09,215 --> 00:47:10,592
that'll be our ass!

498
00:47:10,675 --> 00:47:12,885
I know, man.
It's getting thick real quick.

499
00:47:12,969 --> 00:47:15,722
We need a way out, got to
come up with an exit strategy.

500
00:47:15,804 --> 00:47:17,681
- Exit strategy?
- Yeah.

501
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:23,021
I like the way that sounds.
What you got in mind?

502
00:47:23,103 --> 00:47:26,148
I don't know.
But we need two more cars.

503
00:47:33,947 --> 00:47:35,532
Here they come.

504
00:47:54,677 --> 00:47:57,929
Fonzie and Fabio.
Glad you could join us.

505
00:47:58,931 --> 00:48:01,934
We hear you want to get rid
of those Cracker Jack toys.

506
00:48:02,018 --> 00:48:03,518
No, we figured your cars...

507
00:48:03,603 --> 00:48:06,773
deserve better drivers,
so we'll take them off your hands.

508
00:48:06,856 --> 00:48:08,398
Why don't we settle this now?

509
00:48:08,483 --> 00:48:11,277
Wait. How about we settle
this on the blacktop?

510
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:15,405
Each car does a down-and-back,
tag-team style. For slips.

511
00:48:15,614 --> 00:48:17,115
Loser walks home.

512
00:48:17,199 --> 00:48:19,827
- We came to race.
- Load them up then.

513
00:48:23,581 --> 00:48:25,500
Let's get these cars.

514
00:48:27,335 --> 00:48:30,880
Check it out. There's no way
we'll beat these guys straight up.

515
00:48:30,963 --> 00:48:33,382
That Hemi's putting out about 425...

516
00:48:33,507 --> 00:48:36,844
and that Yenko will snap
a speedo in five seconds flat.

517
00:48:37,512 --> 00:48:39,639
We have to pull something
out of our ass.

518
00:48:39,722 --> 00:48:43,059
I think we should save
the spray for the way back.

519
00:48:43,768 --> 00:48:46,061
Done deal.
Let's do this, bro.

520
00:48:46,228 --> 00:48:48,481
I'm getting that orange one.

521
00:48:50,483 --> 00:48:52,527
You ain't ready, Fabio!

522
00:48:56,864 --> 00:48:57,989
All right.

523
00:48:58,114 --> 00:49:01,494
You each got a barrel to go around
down at the end of the road.

524
00:49:01,869 --> 00:49:05,456
Second wave's got to sit tight till
your partner crosses this line here.

525
00:49:05,539 --> 00:49:08,583
First team to go down and back twice
wins the race.

526
00:49:08,918 --> 00:49:10,670
At which point...

527
00:49:11,878 --> 00:49:15,423
the losers will hand over them keys.

528
00:49:15,507 --> 00:49:19,010
Or you'll be eating breakfast
through straws from now on.

529
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,766
I get it.

530
00:49:25,309 --> 00:49:27,186
This means you, too.

531
00:49:28,019 --> 00:49:29,188
I got it.

532
00:49:29,271 --> 00:49:31,356
All right. Let's race.

533
00:49:35,652 --> 00:49:38,947
Come on, baby, you got this, Rome!
This dude ain't serious.

534
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:42,492
Yeah, you gone, homey.
I got this. This is done.

535
00:49:44,077 --> 00:49:45,538
You about to lose your car.

536
00:49:45,621 --> 00:49:47,748
- Do it, Rome!
- Come on, you got it, man.

537
00:49:47,831 --> 00:49:52,043
Think I'm worried about this fool?
This is nothing!

538
00:50:02,762 --> 00:50:04,974
- Oh, no.
- American muscle.

539
00:50:07,726 --> 00:50:10,563
Your engine ain't as big
as your mouth.

540
00:50:15,735 --> 00:50:18,403
Got to smoke him.

541
00:50:18,487 --> 00:50:19,822
All right, here we go!

542
00:50:19,905 --> 00:50:22,907
- It's all right, I'll handle this.
- Handle it.

543
00:50:23,826 --> 00:50:26,786
Ready, and... go!

544
00:50:33,251 --> 00:50:36,047
You ain't ready!
I run these streets!

545
00:50:45,681 --> 00:50:48,266
Romey Rome! You ain't heard of me?

546
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:07,494
Oh, shit.

547
00:51:12,248 --> 00:51:13,626
Oh, yeah!

548
00:51:18,588 --> 00:51:20,340
I'm gonna get you.

549
00:51:22,425 --> 00:51:24,135
Where's your big mouth now?

550
00:51:24,219 --> 00:51:26,554
That car's going home with me.

551
00:51:37,398 --> 00:51:39,652
Shit. Eat this, sucker!

552
00:51:53,833 --> 00:51:55,000
Shit!

553
00:51:59,295 --> 00:52:01,798
Yeah, boy! Go, Korpi!

554
00:52:05,010 --> 00:52:07,929
Sorry, blondie,
how does that dust taste?

555
00:52:10,349 --> 00:52:11,851
I don't know.

556
00:52:12,851 --> 00:52:14,394
Come on, Rome.

557
00:52:42,882 --> 00:52:44,173
What the...

558
00:52:44,257 --> 00:52:47,302
Good move, kid.
Let's see if you got the balls.

559
00:53:10,451 --> 00:53:11,784
Shit, come on.

560
00:53:21,753 --> 00:53:23,963
Come on, Brian, bring it home, man!

561
00:54:06,507 --> 00:54:08,342
We got two new cars!

562
00:54:09,842 --> 00:54:11,010
Damn!

563
00:54:18,268 --> 00:54:21,146
Y'all ain't ready!
Get to walking, Fabio!

564
00:54:22,606 --> 00:54:24,608
Use them bus tokens!

565
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,242
How are you?
What's your name?

566
00:54:34,326 --> 00:54:35,702
We're Mr. Verone's guests.

567
00:54:46,045 --> 00:54:47,965
It's a hoasis in here.

568
00:54:48,465 --> 00:54:50,967
Yeah, lots of potential.

569
00:54:52,802 --> 00:54:55,097
Damn. You got a pen?

570
00:54:58,266 --> 00:55:00,393
It's about to get serious.

571
00:55:01,103 --> 00:55:03,563
Look at that girl on the swing.

572
00:55:03,646 --> 00:55:07,775
You guys did something right.
He never socialises with hired help.

573
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:09,945
Now what's that make you?

574
00:55:10,403 --> 00:55:12,739
- Where's he at?
- He's on his way.

575
00:55:12,822 --> 00:55:14,992
You and Verone
don't go everywhere together?

576
00:55:15,074 --> 00:55:17,869
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

577
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:24,001
- I'm gonna go take a piss.
- You go do that.

578
00:55:28,422 --> 00:55:30,132
What is his deal?

579
00:55:30,507 --> 00:55:32,634
He doesn't trust people
who carry badges.

580
00:55:32,717 --> 00:55:34,719
You talk like you know.

581
00:55:37,264 --> 00:55:41,768
I'd been a cop about two months when
Roman was busted in a garage raid.

582
00:55:42,059 --> 00:55:45,731
He had eight sets of wheels
in his possession, each of them hot.

583
00:55:45,813 --> 00:55:47,565
So you busted him?

584
00:55:47,648 --> 00:55:51,777
I didn't know it was going down.
But that doesn't really matter.

585
00:55:53,362 --> 00:55:58,034
Once I became a cop, Roman saw me
as a friend who became the enemy.

586
00:56:04,458 --> 00:56:07,085
Is there anything I can get for you,
Mr. Verone?

587
00:56:07,168 --> 00:56:09,211
Just tell them
to come join me.

588
00:56:16,135 --> 00:56:17,971
I was admiring this.

589
00:56:27,813 --> 00:56:28,981
Damn.

590
00:56:29,398 --> 00:56:32,235
I'm not giving it to you. What's up?

591
00:56:32,318 --> 00:56:33,695
He's here.

592
00:56:34,195 --> 00:56:35,739
Where's he at?

593
00:56:35,989 --> 00:56:37,532
He's over there. Don't look.

594
00:56:41,577 --> 00:56:44,664
Excuse me, Mr. Verone
would like for you to join him.

595
00:56:45,206 --> 00:56:46,666
Let's do it.

596
00:56:47,208 --> 00:56:49,378
See what I'm talking about?

597
00:56:52,713 --> 00:56:54,632
It's all right, let them in.

598
00:56:57,219 --> 00:56:59,429
Go sit down,
I'll talk to you in a second.

599
00:57:00,639 --> 00:57:02,849
- How you doing?
- Good. Enjoying your night?

600
00:57:02,932 --> 00:57:05,268
- Yeah, I'm having a good time.
- Good.

601
00:57:07,521 --> 00:57:09,398
She's beautiful, isn't she?

602
00:57:16,153 --> 00:57:17,322
Yeah.

603
00:57:18,197 --> 00:57:19,782
She's gorgeous.

604
00:57:26,373 --> 00:57:28,166
You got balls, kid.

605
00:57:29,208 --> 00:57:30,960
I appreciate that.

606
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,088
Women are a powerful force.

607
00:57:35,715 --> 00:57:39,344
You see the blonde sitting
with the gentleman right here?

608
00:57:43,347 --> 00:57:47,601
Five minutes of her time, and she
can get anything she wants from him.

609
00:57:47,893 --> 00:57:49,521
I love your hair.

610
00:57:49,603 --> 00:57:50,813
Watch.

611
00:57:56,945 --> 00:57:59,655
I wonder where they're going?
Sit down.

612
00:58:01,907 --> 00:58:05,286
So you lit my man's car on fire.
Is that right?

613
00:58:07,079 --> 00:58:08,248
Yeah.

614
00:58:09,291 --> 00:58:10,500
I did.

615
00:58:12,376 --> 00:58:15,505
I got a problem with authority.

616
00:58:17,798 --> 00:58:19,842
I have that same problem.

617
00:58:20,385 --> 00:58:24,181
For me, it's cops in particular.

618
00:58:36,443 --> 00:58:38,320
Let's take a walk. Come on.

619
00:58:38,402 --> 00:58:41,322
We just got here.
And now we're leaving.

620
00:58:42,199 --> 00:58:43,532
Let's go.

621
00:58:51,666 --> 00:58:52,708
Hey.

622
00:58:52,791 --> 00:58:53,918
Come on.

623
00:59:16,483 --> 00:59:18,150
What's all that?

624
00:59:20,362 --> 00:59:22,864
We're going to have a little fun.

625
00:59:29,621 --> 00:59:30,996
Thank you.

626
00:59:31,748 --> 00:59:36,168
- It'll be fun. Let's stay longer.
- Yeah.

627
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:40,632
Hey, Carter.

628
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:43,175
Meet Detective Whitworth.

629
00:59:45,302 --> 00:59:47,222
One of Miami's finest.

630
00:59:48,056 --> 00:59:49,891
Thank you, sweetheart.

631
00:59:49,974 --> 00:59:51,768
You enjoying yourself, Detective?

632
00:59:51,851 --> 00:59:53,311
Yeah, I was.

633
00:59:54,144 --> 00:59:56,398
I mean, you know me.

634
00:59:56,773 --> 00:59:57,940
Yeah.

635
00:59:58,525 --> 01:00:00,068
I do know you.

636
01:00:01,777 --> 01:00:03,780
You've been on my payroll
a long time.

637
01:00:03,862 --> 01:00:06,449
- Verone, that ain't right.
- Shut up.

638
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:11,121
I've got one last job for you.
You hear me?

639
01:00:11,204 --> 01:00:13,623
- We've been through this.
- Yeah?

640
01:00:13,956 --> 01:00:15,833
And I said I can't do it.

641
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:20,045
That's the wrong answer.
The table.

642
01:00:25,677 --> 01:00:27,679
I'm a detective, Verone!

643
01:00:27,762 --> 01:00:31,849
You do anything to me, the whole
force'll be on your ass in a minute.

644
01:00:31,932 --> 01:00:35,061
Shut your mouth,
you fat piece of shit.

645
01:00:35,936 --> 01:00:37,521
Stop right now.

646
01:00:43,737 --> 01:00:45,280
What the hell?

647
01:00:45,487 --> 01:00:46,822
Sit down.

648
01:00:47,449 --> 01:00:50,201
You're going to regret this.
Stop right now!

649
01:00:50,284 --> 01:00:52,829
Once the bucket
gets hot enough, Detective...

650
01:00:52,911 --> 01:00:55,623
the rat is gonna want out.

651
01:00:57,416 --> 01:01:00,253
And the only direction it can go,
is south.

652
01:01:04,423 --> 01:01:05,800
Hold that.

653
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:07,844
Get it off me!

654
01:01:07,969 --> 01:01:09,052
I'll forget it-

655
01:01:09,137 --> 01:01:10,429
Shut up.

656
01:01:11,306 --> 01:01:15,976
Did you know that your average rat
can chew through a steel drainpipe?

657
01:01:17,311 --> 01:01:20,565
You have nothing to worry about
when he's screaming.

658
01:01:20,648 --> 01:01:23,400
It's when he goes quiet
that he goes to work.

659
01:01:23,485 --> 01:01:25,152
Stop it!

660
01:01:26,487 --> 01:01:29,865
You can't be this stupid!
Stop it now!

661
01:01:29,949 --> 01:01:33,452
You're in charge of the units
that are watching my properties.

662
01:01:34,036 --> 01:01:36,539
What I want is a 15-minute window...

663
01:01:36,623 --> 01:01:39,333
where everybody,
and I mean everybody, disappears.

664
01:01:39,416 --> 01:01:41,920
- I can't do it!
- You can't?

665
01:01:44,005 --> 01:01:45,297
Stop it.

666
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:47,675
Okay. Monica, come here.

667
01:01:48,009 --> 01:01:49,260
Help!

668
01:01:50,302 --> 01:01:51,762
Shut him up.

669
01:01:52,972 --> 01:01:54,641
Help!

670
01:02:00,813 --> 01:02:02,273
It's biting me!

671
01:02:03,983 --> 01:02:05,150
What?

672
01:02:07,152 --> 01:02:09,155
Got something you want to say?

673
01:02:10,782 --> 01:02:12,824
It bit me. Jesus.

674
01:02:13,952 --> 01:02:16,246
- I'll do it!
- Do what? Say it.

675
01:02:16,329 --> 01:02:19,081
I'll do it.
I'll give you your window.

676
01:02:20,291 --> 01:02:21,960
Just get it off me.

677
01:02:22,043 --> 01:02:23,460
Get it off!

678
01:02:25,545 --> 01:02:27,215
You betray me...

679
01:02:27,923 --> 01:02:29,717
and my rat here...

680
01:02:30,592 --> 01:02:33,179
is gonna visit your wife, Lynn...

681
01:02:33,596 --> 01:02:36,224
your son, Clay,
and your daughter, Lexi.

682
01:02:36,306 --> 01:02:38,893
Do you hear me?
Do you understand me?

683
01:02:39,226 --> 01:02:41,019
- Hear me?
- Get it off.

684
01:02:41,103 --> 01:02:44,106
I'll burn your fucking eyes out!
I'll burn them out.

685
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:49,528
Now, you can go.

686
01:02:50,445 --> 01:02:53,115
Get rid of him. Let's go.
Get it off.

687
01:03:02,625 --> 01:03:04,460
You boys enjoy the show?

688
01:03:05,085 --> 01:03:08,715
Fifteen minutes, and then every cop
in Florida's gonna be on you.

689
01:03:08,797 --> 01:03:12,760
Be at Versailles Cafč at 6:00 a. m,
day after tomorrow, ready to drive.

690
01:03:12,844 --> 01:03:14,804
- You understand?
- Yeah.

691
01:03:14,929 --> 01:03:16,889
Don't play games with me...

692
01:03:17,431 --> 01:03:19,851
or you'll be next. All right?

693
01:03:20,476 --> 01:03:23,396
Help yourself to a little champagne.
Let's go.

694
01:03:26,481 --> 01:03:28,317
That was a damn rat.

695
01:03:37,994 --> 01:03:42,498
You ever touch another man again,
and I'll kill you.

696
01:03:42,706 --> 01:03:44,166
You hear me?

697
01:03:45,793 --> 01:03:47,836
Look at me. You hear me?

698
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:57,764
She was into it.
What's that about?

699
01:03:58,347 --> 01:04:00,932
You seen the way she grabbed
the dude's head.

700
01:04:01,016 --> 01:04:05,521
She had to. He was testing her.
Her ass is on the line, like ours.

701
01:04:06,396 --> 01:04:08,483
You're feeling this girl
way too much.

702
01:04:08,565 --> 01:04:12,235
She's like that trailer rat
from back in the day, Tanya.

703
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:15,447
Tanya? Man, you went out with her
after I did.

704
01:04:16,699 --> 01:04:18,742
I couldn't let it go to waste.

705
01:04:18,826 --> 01:04:20,202
I got you.

706
01:04:20,786 --> 01:04:22,288
Is that right?

707
01:04:22,371 --> 01:04:25,291
We go race for cash,
but when I step on the gas...

708
01:04:25,373 --> 01:04:28,543
my nitrous go blast,
leave your ass in the past.

709
01:04:28,628 --> 01:04:30,880
Tej, you about
to lose your garage.

710
01:04:30,963 --> 01:04:32,380
Whatever, man.

711
01:04:32,465 --> 01:04:35,134
I'm a low-budget mechanic,
but I overcharge.

712
01:04:35,217 --> 01:04:38,012
Pay me! Let's go, man.

713
01:04:38,304 --> 01:04:39,972
Pay me my money.

714
01:04:40,056 --> 01:04:43,184
I'm glad you're happy.
This is my garage.

715
01:04:43,809 --> 01:04:46,186
Royal flush. Give me this, man.

716
01:04:46,646 --> 01:04:48,105
Talk to him.

717
01:04:48,271 --> 01:04:52,818
Put that money back on the table.
You know it's mine next hand.

718
01:04:52,902 --> 01:04:56,947
Jimmy, how're you gonna pay me back
if you keep losing to Tej like that?

719
01:04:57,197 --> 01:05:00,201
I'm going to crash, Tej.
I'll catch you tomorrow.

720
01:05:16,592 --> 01:05:17,927
What are you doing here?

721
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:21,889
They're gonna kill you. I heard him
telling Enrique and Roberto.

722
01:05:21,972 --> 01:05:25,101
Once you finish the run, they're
putting a bullet in your head.

723
01:05:25,434 --> 01:05:27,269
You sure you heard him right?

724
01:05:27,519 --> 01:05:28,561
I'm sure.

725
01:05:36,152 --> 01:05:38,239
Verone's boys is outside...

726
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:42,702
I see what they're looking for.
Your little girlfriend here.

727
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:50,458
- They don't know. I snuck out.
- What are they doing here then?

728
01:05:50,543 --> 01:05:52,545
I don't know.
Maybe they're guessing.

729
01:05:53,003 --> 01:05:55,505
Go stall them for,
like, two minutes.

730
01:05:55,588 --> 01:05:57,550
Check her, homey.

731
01:06:02,722 --> 01:06:05,056
Found what you're
looking for?

732
01:06:09,436 --> 01:06:12,063
Hey, buddy. Hi, guys. How you doing?

733
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:16,068
Y'all still mad about y'all car?

734
01:06:16,152 --> 01:06:19,070
Don't even trip.
Come on, man, can't you take a joke?

735
01:06:19,947 --> 01:06:23,034
This isn't about being a good cop
or doing your job.

736
01:06:23,117 --> 01:06:25,161
They're gonna kill you.
You gotta pull out.

737
01:06:25,244 --> 01:06:27,496
Verone pay you
to keep a straight face like that?

738
01:06:27,579 --> 01:06:31,583
'Cause if I was making money,
I'd remove that mole off my nose.

739
01:06:31,666 --> 01:06:33,668
- Okay?
- Yeah.

740
01:06:33,753 --> 01:06:35,920
How much he pay y'all anyway?

741
01:06:36,005 --> 01:06:39,550
Every time I see y'all,
y'all got the silk shirts on...

742
01:06:39,632 --> 01:06:41,885
jewellery, looking real Miami.

743
01:06:42,385 --> 01:06:46,931
I caught you walking up in the club,
the hamburger meat all hanging out.

744
01:06:48,851 --> 01:06:51,394
Don't make that run, Brian.

745
01:06:52,228 --> 01:06:53,646
Be careful.

746
01:07:07,369 --> 01:07:10,498
Where are you going?
You stay right here with us, buddy.

747
01:07:19,422 --> 01:07:21,257
Don't even think about it.

748
01:07:33,478 --> 01:07:36,398
Stay your ass off my homeboy's boat.

749
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:46,074
Put the gun down now!

750
01:07:46,367 --> 01:07:48,077
You first, asshole!

751
01:07:48,159 --> 01:07:49,994
I'll shoot the shit out of him!

752
01:07:55,291 --> 01:08:00,005
Put down the gun!

753
01:08:00,965 --> 01:08:02,590
Enough.

754
01:08:02,967 --> 01:08:04,842
Shut up.

755
01:08:06,554 --> 01:08:08,347
It's over. Come on.

756
01:08:08,847 --> 01:08:10,391
It's over. Let's go.

757
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:13,686
It's our gun. Come on, let's go.

758
01:08:18,983 --> 01:08:21,694
I'm glad to see you boys
are getting along so well...

759
01:08:21,777 --> 01:08:26,532
because tomorrow, Roberto and
Enrique'll be riding along with you.

760
01:08:26,990 --> 01:08:29,076
Just so we don't have any problems.

761
01:08:29,158 --> 01:08:31,078
I'll see you guys in a bit.

762
01:08:34,957 --> 01:08:37,083
What the hell
was she doing in there?

763
01:08:47,845 --> 01:08:50,096
Where'd you go this morning?

764
01:08:50,221 --> 01:08:52,765
I went to breakfast
with some friends.

765
01:08:58,479 --> 01:08:59,981
With friends?

766
01:09:01,942 --> 01:09:04,069
I do have friends, Carter.

767
01:09:10,743 --> 01:09:11,909
Okay.

768
01:09:13,912 --> 01:09:15,456
I'll see you later.

769
01:09:24,797 --> 01:09:26,216
Nice shirt, Bilkins.

770
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:27,967
It's my day off.

771
01:09:30,054 --> 01:09:31,764
Well, anyhow, this is the deal.

772
01:09:32,305 --> 01:09:35,641
Last night, Verone threatened a cop
into giving us a window.

773
01:09:35,725 --> 01:09:39,020
We're driving to an airstrip
in the Keys, off Nallwood Avenue.

774
01:09:39,104 --> 01:09:41,731
Verone has a plane there
and he's taking off for good.

775
01:09:41,814 --> 01:09:43,692
Wait a minute. How do you know this?

776
01:09:43,984 --> 01:09:45,234
Monica.

777
01:09:45,652 --> 01:09:48,447
She's doing her job. She warned us.

778
01:09:48,529 --> 01:09:49,989
She warned you about what?

779
01:09:50,073 --> 01:09:52,533
Verone plans to kill us
after we give him the money.

780
01:09:52,618 --> 01:09:55,996
Driving into an ambush
wasn't the deal. I'm calling it off.

781
01:09:56,079 --> 01:09:59,416
Like hell you are.
This is a Customs case, Bilkins.

782
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:01,667
No one's calling this off
unless I do.

783
01:10:01,752 --> 01:10:03,587
Look, this is real simple.

784
01:10:04,128 --> 01:10:08,466
Make the run, get Verone and his
cash together, so I can move in.

785
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:11,761
You don't, I'll file enough charges
on you to make you disappear.

786
01:10:11,845 --> 01:10:13,262
Take these.

787
01:10:13,346 --> 01:10:16,766
We're gonna have GPS on you
so you don't get any cute ideas.

788
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:19,019
And to make sure
nothing happens to them, right?

789
01:10:19,101 --> 01:10:20,561
Yeah, right.

790
01:10:29,404 --> 01:10:31,155
That guy's a dick.

791
01:10:34,201 --> 01:10:36,161
Let me get this right.

792
01:10:36,537 --> 01:10:39,122
If we don't do this,
then we go to jail.

793
01:10:39,497 --> 01:10:42,458
But if we do it,
then Verone's going to kill us.

794
01:10:42,626 --> 01:10:45,712
- It's a hell of a deal, huh?
- Yeah.

795
01:10:47,296 --> 01:10:48,756
Maybe it is.

796
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:54,637
This guy's got an ass full of loot
that he's ready to dump in our cars.

797
01:10:54,971 --> 01:10:59,141
I can think of two reasons why
he doesn't need that money anymore.

798
01:10:59,225 --> 01:11:00,601
Here we go.

799
01:11:00,685 --> 01:11:02,104
You and me.

800
01:11:02,311 --> 01:11:03,939
Just like the old days.

801
01:11:04,021 --> 01:11:08,318
- What do you think?
- They messed with the wrong guys.

802
01:11:11,445 --> 01:11:13,657
- Tej, what's up, bro?
- What's up?

803
01:11:13,739 --> 01:11:15,367
How quickly can you organise?

804
01:11:15,449 --> 01:11:18,244
Look, if y'all really want
to carry out this plan...

805
01:11:18,328 --> 01:11:21,789
this is the best place to do it.
What do y'all think?

806
01:11:21,872 --> 01:11:24,458
I think it's perfect.
So, what do they store here?

807
01:11:30,465 --> 01:11:31,800
This thing is clean.

808
01:11:31,882 --> 01:11:33,092
Distributor cap.

809
01:11:47,774 --> 01:11:52,612
Jimmy, do we have any half-empty
bottles of nitrous lying around?

810
01:11:52,695 --> 01:11:54,780
Sure, but I've already
loaded you for spray.

811
01:11:54,864 --> 01:11:57,533
I'm thinking we may need it
for something else...

812
01:11:57,617 --> 01:12:00,412
'cause our cars may get
a little crowded, you know?

813
01:12:08,753 --> 01:12:11,297
When did you start eating so much?

814
01:12:12,298 --> 01:12:14,176
I was in jail, bruh.

815
01:12:14,509 --> 01:12:17,345
I know how shitty the grub is
on the inside.

816
01:12:18,471 --> 01:12:21,099
The way things are shaping up
out here right now...

817
01:12:21,182 --> 01:12:24,394
it'll be a matter of time
before I'm back in there, or dead.

818
01:12:25,895 --> 01:12:28,899
So I'm trying to eat all I can
while I can.

819
01:12:30,524 --> 01:12:33,819
Plus, the doctor tells me
I got a high metabolism.

820
01:12:38,533 --> 01:12:40,534
You remember us growing up?

821
01:12:41,118 --> 01:12:43,412
Playing football in the dirt?

822
01:12:44,288 --> 01:12:47,708
Getting into trouble.
All the stupid things we did?

823
01:12:48,918 --> 01:12:51,921
When you got busted,
whether I was a cop or not...

824
01:12:52,005 --> 01:12:54,256
if there was anything
I could have done...

825
01:12:55,132 --> 01:12:57,010
I would have done it.

826
01:12:57,594 --> 01:12:59,762
I just want you to know that.

827
01:13:00,387 --> 01:13:02,890
Is that why
you let that dude go in L.A.?

828
01:13:05,143 --> 01:13:07,854
Yeah, I think
that had a lot to do with it.

829
01:13:10,106 --> 01:13:11,942
When I got busted...

830
01:13:12,525 --> 01:13:13,693
it wasn't your fault.

831
01:13:14,903 --> 01:13:18,198
It was all on me, Mr. Roman Pearce.

832
01:13:18,782 --> 01:13:20,826
Wild and out. Crazy man.

833
01:13:21,868 --> 01:13:24,037
No one could tell me nothing.

834
01:13:24,121 --> 01:13:25,579
Riding solo.

835
01:13:26,206 --> 01:13:27,666
Yeah, well, not anymore.

836
01:13:33,421 --> 01:13:35,131
Not anymore, bro.

837
01:14:00,489 --> 01:14:02,783
I've got Verone's Navigator
leaving the residence.

838
01:14:02,868 --> 01:14:04,034
Copy.

839
01:14:04,743 --> 01:14:07,247
Sir, we've got Verone on the move
to the airstrip.

840
01:14:07,329 --> 01:14:10,125
Let's get a bird in the air.
Tell him to keep his distance.

841
01:14:12,752 --> 01:14:14,212
- Ready.
- Thanks.

842
01:14:15,921 --> 01:14:17,966
- You're all set.
- Thanks.

843
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:21,219
- All set?
- Yeah. Let's do it.

844
01:14:24,305 --> 01:14:25,556
Report.

845
01:14:27,809 --> 01:14:29,935
What's going on
out there?

846
01:14:31,563 --> 01:14:32,771
Team One, checking in.

847
01:14:32,855 --> 01:14:35,567
- Team Two, checking in.
- Team Three, checking in.

848
01:14:35,649 --> 01:14:37,819
Team Four,
all clear here, too.

849
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:40,279
Team Five, checking in.

850
01:14:41,072 --> 01:14:42,907
Team Six, all clear.

851
01:14:48,329 --> 01:14:51,041
- Here we go.
- Yeah, so you know what to do.

852
01:14:51,123 --> 01:14:53,167
Stay cool. Keep focused.

853
01:14:53,542 --> 01:14:56,128
Remember the airstrip's
off Nallwood Avenue.

854
01:14:56,212 --> 01:14:58,465
It's the third exit
after the bridge.

855
01:15:00,132 --> 01:15:01,384
Got it.

856
01:15:01,509 --> 01:15:03,427
You ready for this?

857
01:15:03,511 --> 01:15:07,140
Come on, man.
Guns, murderers, and crooked cops?

858
01:15:07,306 --> 01:15:09,059
I was made for this, bruh!

859
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:46,011
Come on.

860
01:16:09,618 --> 01:16:12,622
I got activity
at Verone's trailer property.

861
01:16:13,038 --> 01:16:15,917
Do not move an inch
until I tell you to!

862
01:16:40,899 --> 01:16:42,193
Load up.

863
01:16:45,029 --> 01:16:46,280
All units...

864
01:16:46,363 --> 01:16:49,408
move on the trailer property.
Right now! Move!

865
01:16:56,332 --> 01:16:59,252
Shit. Local P.D.
is moving in on our guys.

866
01:16:59,668 --> 01:17:02,171
- Three bags in one car?
- Guess so.

867
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:16,895
The cops.

868
01:17:21,189 --> 01:17:22,609
I am not going back to jail.

869
01:17:22,692 --> 01:17:24,860
Where are you going, man? Let's go!

870
01:17:26,237 --> 01:17:27,947
What is he doing?

871
01:17:49,385 --> 01:17:52,846
Now let's get the chopper over them.
I want eyes right on top.

872
01:17:52,930 --> 01:17:54,015
You got it.

873
01:17:54,097 --> 01:17:55,140
Lima 2-5...

874
01:17:55,224 --> 01:17:56,768
follow GPS.

875
01:18:05,109 --> 01:18:07,444
Do you know what you're doing?

876
01:18:10,530 --> 01:18:12,949
Stay with me, Rome. Come on, man.

877
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:23,752
I've got them heading south
on I-95.

878
01:18:23,836 --> 01:18:25,921
Bring in the aerial ESDs.

879
01:18:35,555 --> 01:18:36,724
Oh, shit!

880
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:42,939
- They're catching up, man!
- Shut up, man!

881
01:18:54,699 --> 01:18:56,493
Nice driving, Rome.

882
01:18:56,702 --> 01:18:58,412
I got you, Brian.

883
01:19:03,542 --> 01:19:05,043
Check it out!

884
01:19:17,597 --> 01:19:19,141
What was that?

885
01:19:29,777 --> 01:19:30,944
Oh, shit!

886
01:19:44,708 --> 01:19:47,377
- Come on, man. Take the wheel.
- No. I can't drive.

887
01:19:47,461 --> 01:19:50,756
Just hold the wheel!
Put your hands on it! Hold steady!

888
01:19:54,510 --> 01:19:56,304
What are you doing, man?

889
01:20:51,024 --> 01:20:52,359
Yeah, man!

890
01:21:08,376 --> 01:21:09,542
Hold.

891
01:21:12,087 --> 01:21:14,547
Bilkins, the bird's in place.

892
01:21:18,386 --> 01:21:19,552
Yeah.

893
01:21:21,346 --> 01:21:22,681
We've got Verone's Navigator.

894
01:21:22,765 --> 01:21:25,685
All right. Money's in transit.
Sit tight.

895
01:22:10,229 --> 01:22:12,355
You're a good driver, man.

896
01:22:12,439 --> 01:22:14,442
Thanks, bro.

897
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:23,242
We've got the area blocked ahead.
They've got nowhere to go.

898
01:22:32,333 --> 01:22:33,877
What was that?

899
01:22:34,670 --> 01:22:35,880
I've got a visual.

900
01:22:36,546 --> 01:22:38,673
Video should be coming through.

901
01:22:38,756 --> 01:22:40,634
I got it. Looks good.

902
01:22:42,261 --> 01:22:44,137
Where are they going?

903
01:22:52,438 --> 01:22:53,605
Shit.

904
01:22:58,985 --> 01:23:02,280
All right, Miami's finest,
let's see what you got.

905
01:23:02,989 --> 01:23:05,158
Come on. Stay with me, boys.

906
01:23:11,164 --> 01:23:13,500
Hey, man, everyone's here.
Time for the show.

907
01:23:13,583 --> 01:23:15,502
Let's give it to them.

908
01:23:19,756 --> 01:23:22,635
All right, let the party begin.
Let's go!

909
01:23:41,444 --> 01:23:44,907
This is unit 25-99.
We have the suspects surrounded.

910
01:24:36,708 --> 01:24:38,085
Holy shit!

911
01:24:44,091 --> 01:24:46,592
It's a scramble, baby! A big one!

912
01:24:52,557 --> 01:24:54,393
Yeah! Let's do this!

913
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:03,985
Check this out.

914
01:25:12,286 --> 01:25:14,037
We're not tracking them
on the video.

915
01:25:14,121 --> 01:25:16,582
We must have lost them
in the scramble.

916
01:25:16,664 --> 01:25:18,332
Yo, let's break.

917
01:25:19,792 --> 01:25:20,961
Yeah!

918
01:26:04,128 --> 01:26:06,465
All right, we got them going west
on Beach.

919
01:26:06,547 --> 01:26:08,675
Roger that! I've got them!

920
01:26:20,770 --> 01:26:24,106
Customs has a fix on two cars
going west on Beach.

921
01:26:24,524 --> 01:26:26,359
Roger. Follow those cars.

922
01:26:26,443 --> 01:26:27,860
Roger that.

923
01:26:49,966 --> 01:26:51,134
Shit.

924
01:26:52,176 --> 01:26:53,886
They're cornered.

925
01:26:58,140 --> 01:27:00,851
Keep your hands
where I can see them!

926
01:27:00,935 --> 01:27:02,270
Hands up!

927
01:27:02,813 --> 01:27:06,733
I know my tags are out of date,
but damn.

928
01:27:14,908 --> 01:27:16,451
What the hell?

929
01:27:17,786 --> 01:27:19,371
Where are they?

930
01:27:41,475 --> 01:27:42,978
How about them apples, man?

931
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:46,148
Yeah! That's some driving
for your ass, baby!

932
01:27:47,565 --> 01:27:48,649
Good job, man.

933
01:27:48,734 --> 01:27:50,735
- What are you talking about?
- Whatever.

934
01:27:50,819 --> 01:27:52,779
You're supposed to be
a stone-faced killer!

935
01:27:52,863 --> 01:27:54,698
You were grabbing your seat belt!

936
01:27:54,780 --> 01:27:58,284
Hey, Tej, thanks a lot, bro.
You're clutch. I owe you big time.

937
01:27:58,368 --> 01:28:02,037
Yeah, Brian, you really do owe me.
You really do...

938
01:28:02,913 --> 01:28:03,957
Us.

939
01:28:04,166 --> 01:28:06,585
Suki says you owe us, all right?

940
01:28:08,962 --> 01:28:11,547
- Rome, you there? Come in.
- What's up, man?

941
01:28:11,631 --> 01:28:13,800
Looks like we got
just one trick left.

942
01:28:13,884 --> 01:28:16,595
My pleasure, buddy!
Let's do it, baby!

943
01:28:17,554 --> 01:28:19,765
Maybe we should grab Verone
while we still can.

944
01:28:19,847 --> 01:28:21,307
No! Not yet!

945
01:28:23,435 --> 01:28:24,603
What?

946
01:28:24,685 --> 01:28:25,811
You lost them?

947
01:28:25,895 --> 01:28:27,063
Shit!

948
01:28:27,271 --> 01:28:28,731
Those little pricks are running!

949
01:28:28,814 --> 01:28:30,567
It's your call.
What do you want to do?

950
01:28:30,649 --> 01:28:33,194
We're gonna take him down.
He is not leaving here.

951
01:28:33,819 --> 01:28:35,572
Enjoying the ride?

952
01:28:36,573 --> 01:28:38,240
It's a fast car, huh?

953
01:28:40,034 --> 01:28:42,203
It's a classic. Old school.

954
01:28:42,662 --> 01:28:44,331
American muscle.

955
01:28:46,416 --> 01:28:50,002
This car can do all kinds of things.
Want to see?

956
01:28:51,921 --> 01:28:54,048
Check this out right here, homey.

957
01:28:54,131 --> 01:28:56,426
Hey, what are you doing,
man?

958
01:29:05,976 --> 01:29:07,479
Ejecto seato!

959
01:29:08,145 --> 01:29:10,481
It worked! I love this button!

960
01:29:12,859 --> 01:29:14,610
Stay on your toes!

961
01:29:15,737 --> 01:29:19,198
Mr. O'Conner, it worked!
Blow and go. I'm all clear.

962
01:29:19,448 --> 01:29:21,993
Meet me at the point!
Hurry up! It's on!

963
01:29:22,077 --> 01:29:23,161
All right. 10-4, man.

964
01:29:23,244 --> 01:29:25,079
Are you ready? Let's go!

965
01:29:35,465 --> 01:29:38,176
Let me see your hands!

966
01:29:38,260 --> 01:29:39,511
Freeze!

967
01:29:40,302 --> 01:29:41,512
Clear!

968
01:29:47,894 --> 01:29:51,730
- It's not Verone and Fuentes.
- What do you mean?

969
01:29:51,981 --> 01:29:52,940
Then where the hell are they?

970
01:30:00,532 --> 01:30:02,574
Get off at Tarpon Point.

971
01:30:03,326 --> 01:30:06,662
Tarpon Point?
There's no airstrip at Tarpon Point.

972
01:30:07,497 --> 01:30:10,125
Who said anything about an airstrip?

973
01:30:23,304 --> 01:30:24,514
Brian?

974
01:30:25,222 --> 01:30:27,057
What's the hold-up, bro?

975
01:30:27,266 --> 01:30:29,769
Yo. There's a new plan.
What the hell?

976
01:30:29,853 --> 01:30:33,273
We meet him at Tarpon Point exit,
not the airstrip.

977
01:30:33,355 --> 01:30:36,775
- So, what are you saying?
- Like I said, there's a new plan.

978
01:30:39,112 --> 01:30:40,320
Brian?

979
01:30:40,863 --> 01:30:42,907
Brian? Hello, you there?

980
01:30:44,993 --> 01:30:46,077
Damn!

981
01:30:46,161 --> 01:30:47,619
What the hell is he doing?

982
01:30:47,703 --> 01:30:49,372
The feds are in the wrong place.

983
01:30:49,456 --> 01:30:51,623
Brian's woman is on her own
with Verone.

984
01:30:51,707 --> 01:30:52,751
So...

985
01:30:52,833 --> 01:30:54,752
So Brian's not coming!

986
01:31:10,894 --> 01:31:12,936
- Let him out.
- Get out.

987
01:31:20,569 --> 01:31:21,695
Pop the trunk.

988
01:31:24,157 --> 01:31:25,492
Hurry up.

989
01:31:41,006 --> 01:31:42,257
Where's the rest?

990
01:31:42,341 --> 01:31:44,260
- The other car.
- Another car?

991
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:47,137
- Where's the other car?
- On its way.

992
01:31:47,221 --> 01:31:48,931
- On the way?
- Yeah.

993
01:31:50,140 --> 01:31:51,391
Here's your money.

994
01:31:51,475 --> 01:31:54,813
So you know nothing about the agents
that stormed my jet?

995
01:32:01,694 --> 01:32:05,198
The funny thing is, I only told
one person about the airstrip.

996
01:32:19,587 --> 01:32:23,257
Customs agents sure
are getting pretty, aren't they?

997
01:32:27,554 --> 01:32:29,305
Put her on the boat.

998
01:32:31,390 --> 01:32:33,560
- Let's go.
- Get on the boat.

999
01:32:48,032 --> 01:32:50,158
Hide the cars and get rid of him.

1000
01:32:50,243 --> 01:32:51,743
Back in the car.

1001
01:33:19,439 --> 01:33:20,814
End of the road.

1002
01:33:23,275 --> 01:33:24,694
You know, I like you.

1003
01:33:24,777 --> 01:33:27,738
But I still got to kill you.
It's my job.

1004
01:33:31,326 --> 01:33:32,659
What's that?

1005
01:33:34,119 --> 01:33:35,704
It's Barstow, baby!

1006
01:33:36,079 --> 01:33:37,789
It's about to get ugly!

1007
01:33:45,756 --> 01:33:47,132
Let's go.

1008
01:34:23,002 --> 01:34:24,252
Come on.

1009
01:34:50,779 --> 01:34:52,198
You had me.

1010
01:34:54,367 --> 01:34:55,827
You slipped.

1011
01:34:57,161 --> 01:34:59,913
Eleven and a half months,
and you slipped once.

1012
01:35:01,289 --> 01:35:03,083
Put her downstairs.

1013
01:35:09,215 --> 01:35:10,882
See you in a second.

1014
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:18,015
I thought you was dead.

1015
01:35:18,099 --> 01:35:20,268
Me, too. Thanks for saving my ass.

1016
01:35:20,350 --> 01:35:21,644
What are you doing?

1017
01:35:21,726 --> 01:35:25,064
If Verone sees a helicopter
or Customs boat, she's dead!

1018
01:35:25,146 --> 01:35:26,148
Boat.

1019
01:35:26,481 --> 01:35:28,067
Car. Boat.

1020
01:35:28,484 --> 01:35:30,987
You're not gonna do
what I think you're gonna do?

1021
01:35:31,069 --> 01:35:34,073
- Yeah, I think so. You got my back?
- Yeah.

1022
01:35:34,155 --> 01:35:35,533
All right, put on the seat belt.

1023
01:35:35,615 --> 01:35:37,409
Show him some Dukes of Hazzard shit!

1024
01:35:37,493 --> 01:35:40,246
We're gonna do this big!
Hold on, Rome!

1025
01:35:46,752 --> 01:35:48,421
Brian, you're crazy, man!

1026
01:35:48,503 --> 01:35:50,256
What the hell are you doing?

1027
01:36:16,114 --> 01:36:17,867
I think I broke my arm.

1028
01:36:30,755 --> 01:36:32,213
Get the gun.

1029
01:36:53,152 --> 01:36:54,737
It's over, Carter.

1030
01:37:01,786 --> 01:37:03,037
You okay?

1031
01:37:03,203 --> 01:37:04,371
Yeah!

1032
01:37:05,663 --> 01:37:06,748
I'm great.

1033
01:37:13,046 --> 01:37:14,715
We got him, man.

1034
01:37:15,632 --> 01:37:18,219
We got him. Let's get out of here.

1035
01:37:38,322 --> 01:37:39,739
Go, go.

1036
01:37:48,998 --> 01:37:50,583
That ought to do it.

1037
01:37:51,252 --> 01:37:54,838
So, there were three bags total?
The three from the boat?

1038
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:57,675
So we're good, right?

1039
01:37:58,050 --> 01:37:59,385
Our records are clean?

1040
01:37:59,467 --> 01:38:01,136
You held up your end.

1041
01:38:01,720 --> 01:38:03,389
Your records are clean.

1042
01:38:21,532 --> 01:38:23,868
So maybe there were six bags.

1043
01:38:24,827 --> 01:38:26,828
I guess we can call it even.

1044
01:38:27,078 --> 01:38:28,413
Agent Dunn?

1045
01:38:32,710 --> 01:38:34,627
We found some more evidence.

1046
01:38:37,046 --> 01:38:38,716
Let's take it inside.

1047
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:44,971
Don't drop the soap, big homey.

1048
01:38:47,307 --> 01:38:50,728
I hope you know when he gets out,
he's going to kill your ass.

1049
01:38:52,061 --> 01:38:53,896
He ain't getting out.

1050
01:38:55,524 --> 01:38:56,942
I'll see you soon.

1051
01:38:57,484 --> 01:39:00,487
- You think he's going to get out?
- He'll be out.

1052
01:39:01,697 --> 01:39:04,073
Not for real.
You think he's getting out?

1053
01:39:04,742 --> 01:39:07,243
We took care of your decoys.
They're free and clear.

1054
01:39:07,328 --> 01:39:09,622
There's a sedan
out on the road for you.

1055
01:39:09,704 --> 01:39:11,873
Try to bring it back in one piece.

1056
01:39:13,958 --> 01:39:16,462
Thanks a lot, Bilkins.
You're all right.

1057
01:39:17,462 --> 01:39:19,172
Thanks for looking out.

1058
01:39:21,634 --> 01:39:23,510
Do you trust me now?

1059
01:39:23,636 --> 01:39:25,136
You're all right.

1060
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:30,768
Sorry.

1061
01:39:32,144 --> 01:39:34,063
Nice working with you, O'Conner.

1062
01:39:34,188 --> 01:39:35,521
Same here.

1063
01:39:47,784 --> 01:39:51,872
I might have to stay here in Miami,
and keep you out of trouble, bruh.

1064
01:39:54,666 --> 01:39:56,502
You know what I'm talking about.

1065
01:39:56,585 --> 01:39:58,753
You're going to kick it
in Miami?

1066
01:39:59,128 --> 01:40:02,173
I love Miami.
Miami is off the hook!

1067
01:40:04,342 --> 01:40:06,386
Open a garage together.

1068
01:40:07,179 --> 01:40:10,015
A garage?
How are we going to do that?

1069
01:40:14,895 --> 01:40:16,979
Pockets ain't empty, cuz.

1070
01:40:21,068 --> 01:40:23,319
And we ain't hungry
no more, right?
