1
00:00:01,101 --> 00:00:02,932
ANOTHER ONE

2
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:10,110
This happened to me when
I was on the business trip.

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,279
There was an academic conference,

4
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:16,248
so all hotels were booked up.

5
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:20,153
I managed to get a twin room in this hotel.

6
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:23,452
It's sad using a twin room by myself.

7
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:34,800
Yes.

8
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:53,007
I had a bad feeling about the room.

9
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:50,566
Here it is.

10
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:26,779
I'm going to get some sleep.

11
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:28,644
I'm going to sleep.

12
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:42,326
Namu Amida Buddha

13
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,228
Hai.

14
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:50,694
Hai.

15
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,075
Hai.

16
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,082
Hai.

17
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:12,485
Hai.

18
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:26,135
Let's go!

19
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:32,505
Let's go!

20
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:33,734
Let's go!

21
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:41,220
Let's go!

22
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:45,255
Let's go!

23
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,088
Let's go!

24
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,093
Let's go!

25
00:03:58,504 --> 00:03:59,334
Let's go!

26
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:04,440
That's enough.

27
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:44,617
Maybe the receptionist knew something?

28
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,286
Perhaps in that room...

29
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:50,552
a high school basketball coach
hung himself.

30
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:54,394
They didn't confirm this.

31
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:56,394
The End

32
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:59,562
THE MEN IN BLACK

33
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:02,401
Minoru! What happened to you?

34
00:05:02,401 --> 00:05:03,993
Who are they?

35
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:08,798
Tell me who they are!

36
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:24,757
That can't be.

37
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:26,987
They must be Frisbees.

38
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,295
They are real.

39
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:32,560
The last one turned out be an airplane.

40
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:36,768
Look!

41
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,067
Not again...

42
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:53,351
I just took something much more amazing.

43
00:05:54,086 --> 00:05:57,021
I bet this is genuine.

44
00:06:01,193 --> 00:06:02,395
I'm home!

45
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,396
Hi!

46
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,731
What have you done, Minoru?

47
00:06:05,731 --> 00:06:06,299
What?

48
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:09,802
Come off it. Strange people came down.

49
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,537
They said they knew you.

50
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,939
I don't know.

51
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:18,144
These huge guys were dressed all in black.

52
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,613
Completely black.

53
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,081
Who are they?

54
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:23,883
I really don't know.

55
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,418
Give us some drink!

56
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,045
Minoru!

57
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,254
What's this?

58
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,357
Mom!

59
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:43,569
Who did that?

60
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,371
What are you talking about?

61
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:48,708
My room is a mess.

62
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,199
I don't know. It's your fault.

63
00:06:51,243 --> 00:06:54,714
Liar.

64
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,978
Cut it out!

65
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,953
Hello.

66
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:03,155
It's me.

67
00:07:03,155 --> 00:07:04,423
Are you sure?

68
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:06,959
Ok, I'll come right away.

69
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,654
Thank you.

70
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:14,567
Toshihiko, I had a call

71
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,335
from Bermuda magazine.

72
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,638
They're going to publish my picture.

73
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,936
They want to speak to me now.

74
00:07:24,276 --> 00:07:27,040
Minoru didn't come back.

75
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,420
Thank you.

76
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,689
Not at all.

77
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:40,926
His parents asked the police to search for him.

78
00:07:40,926 --> 00:07:42,621
Goodbye.

79
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,681
Yokoyama

80
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,456
Toshihiko,

81
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:12,258
aren't you?

82
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,226
Minoru is -

83
00:08:14,226 --> 00:08:15,995
waiting for you.

84
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,297
Come with us,

85
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:20,332
Shall we?

86
00:08:20,332 --> 00:08:21,856
No!

87
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:59,161
What are you doing there?

88
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:08,141
Are you OK?

89
00:09:08,647 --> 00:09:10,638
Who the hell are they?

90
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,784
Minoru's back!

91
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,793
What happened, Minoru?

92
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:23,091
Who are they?

93
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:27,655
Tell me who they are!

94
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,505
I'm sorry.

95
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:35,804
I stole the negative.

96
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,269
I'm so sorry.

97
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,112
The End

98
00:09:52,257 --> 00:09:55,158
PURIFICATION DOESN'T WORK

99
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:04,436
I wanted to work in the film industry.

100
00:10:04,436 --> 00:10:08,770
I got a job with a film studio
prop department.

101
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:13,477
But there was a gap between
my ideals and reality.

102
00:10:13,712 --> 00:10:18,172
The salary wasn't much and the work was hard.

103
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:32,260
Take that cigarette out of your mouth.

104
00:10:32,998 --> 00:10:36,525
No one uses this crap nowadays.

105
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,563
That's not the point!

106
00:10:43,575 --> 00:10:45,177
I'll wash it.

107
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:50,444
A prop is an actor's tool.

108
00:10:52,317 --> 00:10:57,890
Each dress and prop has their own spirit.

109
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:03,462
So...you have to take good care of them.

110
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:04,895
I understand.

111
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,160
You'd better quit soon, too.

112
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,375
Is that...

113
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:23,713
Get rid of it.

114
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:40,632
Everybody's already gone so why...

115
00:11:40,632 --> 00:11:45,070
The noise was from the shelf
where blood-stained armor lay.

116
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,163
Mr. Tadano.

117
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,044
Mr. Tadano.

118
00:12:10,395 --> 00:12:12,158
Who are you?

119
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:26,445
Actor fatality on film set.

120
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:29,214
Was it this man?

121
00:12:29,214 --> 00:12:31,614
I didn't see his face.

122
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:37,148
The budget was tight but they were ambitious.

123
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:40,883
The film industry was on a decline.

124
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:44,763
They were slacking.

125
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:48,167
They didn't pay out wages.

126
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,432
The staff gradually left one by one.

127
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,698
As did I.

128
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:57,676
All the armor was left on set.

129
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:59,211
Was that blood?

130
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:06,208
The device under his armor went off too soon.

131
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:10,481
He was still a young actor.

132
00:13:12,524 --> 00:13:16,392
If only I were there.

133
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,531
I can't regret enough.

134
00:13:19,531 --> 00:13:22,568
We must do a purification ceremony.

135
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:25,799
We've done it many times.

136
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:34,573
But...despite the ceremony and prayers,

137
00:13:36,114 --> 00:13:42,144
The spirits wouldn't budge.

138
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:52,592
The props have souls.

139
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,930
What are you going to do?

140
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:59,004
Are you going to quit, too?

141
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,340
No.

142
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,366
I like films.

143
00:14:04,776 --> 00:14:07,613
I won't quit. No matter what.

144
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:10,173
Ok.

145
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:16,216
Right.

146
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:33,572
After a short while, Tadano died.

147
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:39,169
He fell down a flight of stairs.

148
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:49,210
The End

149
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:52,624
OVERTIME (Part 1)

150
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:02,791
Can this make the deadline?

151
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,093
Shouldn't be any problem.

152
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,273
2 months ago,

153
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:09,609
Baba from PR was the first

154
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:12,945
Staff that did overtime on the
20th of the month are now missing

155
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,914
So this says

156
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,884
Self-immolation of an female employee

157
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:20,386
after ending affair with a younger man.

158
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:22,755
Please take care.

159
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,390
It's bullshit.

160
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,892
They all left

161
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:27,723
because they hated their jobs.

162
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,591
Mr. Shimotakaido.

163
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:33,955
Can you do overtime today?

164
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,760
Tonight?

165
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,042
You have a date tonight.

166
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,411
Yes, today is my girlfriend's birthday.

167
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,947
It must be hard to be a man.

168
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:52,585
She'd appreciate a hard worker.

169
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:53,953
It is just another birthday.

170
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,251
I'm sure she won't mind.

171
00:15:56,489 --> 00:16:02,155
I've done it.

172
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:05,090
OK!

173
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,160
Thanks.

174
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:16,175
What's up? You weren't all here.

175
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:21,113
Shimako is nice, don't you think?

176
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,716
A real woman.

177
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:28,921
But that type of a woman can be daunting.

178
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,156
It doesn't matter.

179
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,714
She's like a big sister.

180
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,293
Surprised?

181
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:39,465
If you are to talk such crap,
you'll be eaten by an old woman.

182
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:44,129
Shimako could be such the lady.

183
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,908
Give me a break.

184
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:50,773
A rumor, nothing more.

185
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,910
It's just a rumor.

186
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:03,456
It's over. If work means more to you than me.

187
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:04,957
Then die!

188
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:13,922
I hate overtime.

189
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:28,670
Damn.

190
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:36,756
Hello, Accounting Department.

191
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:40,317
Hello.

192
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,024
Is this...

193
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:49,932
I was reading this earlier.

194
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,081
Hello.

195
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:08,214
Oh...

196
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:35,646
It's hot.

197
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:41,581
It's hot.

198
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,032
Oh...

199
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:43,705
To Be Continued

200
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:47,176
OVERTIME (Part 2)

201
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:55,616
Your scream surprised me.

202
00:19:55,694 --> 00:20:00,733
Why did you return to the office this late?

203
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:04,470
I forgot some papers I needed for tomorrow.

204
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,872
I'm going to drop them off

205
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,975
before coming here.

206
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:12,444
I see.

207
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:14,947
Did you think I was a ghost?

208
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:15,414
What?

209
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:16,648
That rumor?

210
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:18,984
When a young man works overtime by himself.

211
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:22,021
They bump into an old woman's ghost.

212
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:24,256
I could never say you are old.

213
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:26,525
Don't be nice to me.

214
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:29,528
Let's go home. It's deadline day tomorrow.

215
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:33,760
And I'm scared of ghosts

216
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:46,245
Wasn't your girlfriend upset?

217
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,014
Yes, she was furious.

218
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:52,084
I have to call her later to make it up to her.

219
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:56,384
Young women are a pain in the ass.

220
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,664
Don't be silly. They are only mannequins.

221
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:06,824
You're right.

222
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:18,210
I had a younger boyfriend quite sometime ago.

223
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,373
Did you?

224
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:24,448
He was fun.

225
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:28,087
I envy youth.

226
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:32,114
You're still young and attractive.

227
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,327
You think so?

228
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:39,498
Can you fall in love with an old lady like me?

229
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:42,634
Of course.

230
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:46,536
Then shall we go somewhere?

231
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,440
What?

232
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,977
Forget the girlfriend.

233
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,376
Well, but...

234
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:09,428
It's not good, Shimako.

235
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:11,259
Everybody will know.

236
00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:15,962
And we do work in the same department.

237
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:20,539
You are sweating so much.

238
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,905
It's cold today.

239
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:26,602
Why are you looking at me like that?

240
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:31,150
You aren't thinking naughty thoughts, are you?

241
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:35,387
I'd never do such a thing in public.

242
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:36,788
In public?

243
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:40,918
Many people go in at the last floor.

244
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:56,008
This does not stop at this floor.

245
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:57,142
It's 5 past midnight.

246
00:22:57,142 --> 00:23:00,913
This does not stop at this floor.

247
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:02,748
On the 20th.

248
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:05,012
The deadline.

249
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:10,953
Shimako.

250
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:13,584
Shimako.

251
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:20,029
I ask you again.

252
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,167
Are you sure

253
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:27,806
you can fall for...

254
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:29,774
an old lady like me?

255
00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:33,812
Can you fall for

256
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:35,006
an old lady like me?

257
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:39,877
Can you fall for me?

258
00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:18,223
Tomorrow is the deadline.

259
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,748
It's going to be busy.

260
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:33,361
The End

261
00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:37,165
SECOND ROUND

262
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:10,901
For hire

263
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:13,906
Central Hospital

264
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:27,782
Welcome!

265
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,796
Thanks! But that's what I should say.

266
00:25:30,796 --> 00:25:32,730
I don't need old folks.

267
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:37,966
Money is money, I suppose.

268
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,171
Not for hire

269
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:52,777
Thank you.

270
00:26:11,837 --> 00:26:13,498
Let's go!

271
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:21,380
When I was studying at Waseda

272
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:25,250
I was a team captain.

273
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,386
It was nothing special.

274
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:29,221
I was well-liked...

275
00:26:29,221 --> 00:26:32,925
Despite being captain.

276
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:40,661
But being captain doesn't mean much but...

277
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:42,434
This is my card.

278
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,969
If your bed feels too cold, call me.

279
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:45,903
Of course you can call me tonight!

280
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:48,972
Oh, she's gone.

281
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:53,107
Where's the rest?

282
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:59,281
You freaked me out!

283
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:03,388
To the hospital!

284
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:04,089
To the hospital.

285
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:06,489
Ok.

286
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,670
Central Hospital

287
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,746
Welcome!

288
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:29,715
Sorry to surprise you.

289
00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:33,708
I forgot something so I've come to pick it up.

290
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,335
See you soon.

291
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:01,480
Here comes my honey.

292
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,981
Left something behind?

293
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:04,550
Do get in.

294
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,074
You're cold.

295
00:28:27,506 --> 00:28:29,167
Are you OK?

296
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,277
The taxi stand is crowded,

297
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:35,440
So I'll stop by the traffic circle.

298
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:05,773
Where's the hospital?

299
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:14,581
This is getting spooky. I better get home.

300
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:23,856
You can't escape.

301
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:26,159
The End

302
00:29:26,532 --> 00:29:29,467
A WOMAN NEXT DOOR

303
00:29:31,837 --> 00:29:35,708
This is where I used to live.

304
00:29:35,708 --> 00:29:39,545
The old apartment attracted few tenants.

305
00:29:39,545 --> 00:29:42,581
I lived there without any constraint.

306
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:44,879
And I liked it...

307
00:29:56,195 --> 00:30:06,594
A family has dreams!

308
00:30:12,178 --> 00:30:14,305
Cheers!

309
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:28,557
Oh, no! no!

310
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,316
Hey!

311
00:31:06,098 --> 00:31:09,534
Hot...

312
00:31:12,805 --> 00:31:14,102
Yes.

313
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:21,336
Could you keep the package for the next door?

314
00:31:22,081 --> 00:31:23,605
I beg you.

315
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:26,077
Oh... OK.

316
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:32,853
Sorry...

317
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:41,399
Ok...

318
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:55,608
Yes.

319
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:00,986
Do you have a package for me?

320
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:03,352
Oh, yes.

321
00:32:05,458 --> 00:32:07,393
That's mine.

322
00:32:07,393 --> 00:32:09,728
Thank you.

323
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:11,059
That's heavy.

324
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:28,477
Hey.

325
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:52,228
Alright.

326
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:28,331
Huge!

327
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,314
Hey.

328
00:34:20,526 --> 00:34:23,518
The End

329
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:26,956
MAI'S VOICE

330
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:32,894
The incident happened to Mr. Fujita.

331
00:34:33,272 --> 00:34:37,142
After his only daughter Mai died and

332
00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:40,339
He had just finished his 7th day of mourning.

333
00:34:45,117 --> 00:34:46,880
Mai.

334
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:50,211
You'll get dizzy.

335
00:34:50,856 --> 00:34:52,619
Mai!

336
00:34:54,860 --> 00:35:03,202
It was the voice of his dead daughter.

337
00:35:03,202 --> 00:35:04,736
I just heard things...

338
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:06,572
It was great

339
00:35:06,572 --> 00:35:09,408
for Fujita to hear her voice.

340
00:35:09,408 --> 00:35:11,842
Even it was only in his imagination.

341
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:14,847
It's not your imagination.

342
00:35:14,847 --> 00:35:17,975
Mai!

343
00:35:21,053 --> 00:35:23,544
Mai's Voice

344
00:35:26,892 --> 00:35:31,263
Their daughter's death filled them with grief.

345
00:35:31,263 --> 00:35:34,130
It tore the couples heart in 2.

346
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:38,495
It was painful.

347
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,639
Then one day...

348
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,708
Keep your chin up, Daddy.

349
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:44,309
Mai.

350
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:47,446
I'll be fine.

351
00:35:47,446 --> 00:35:48,881
I'll do my best.

352
00:35:48,881 --> 00:35:52,417
He discovered that he alone

353
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:55,187
could communicate with her.

354
00:35:55,187 --> 00:35:56,822
Mr. Fujita?

355
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:58,757
Here is...

356
00:35:58,757 --> 00:36:01,658
His mind was always elsewhere.

357
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:06,791
His wife worked at a bar.

358
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:12,629
But her customers couldn't console her.

359
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:17,673
You're over-filling.

360
00:36:19,278 --> 00:36:24,341
She, too, began to hear Mai's voice.

361
00:36:25,384 --> 00:36:27,352
One day,

362
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:30,889
Mr. Fujita visited his wife's bar.

363
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:34,393
You don't normally come here.

364
00:36:34,393 --> 00:36:37,462
What are you wearing?

365
00:36:37,462 --> 00:36:42,331
We're having a fancy dress party tonight.

366
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:48,104
It was organized by a regular customer.

367
00:36:48,907 --> 00:36:53,412
We're doing this to cheer your wife up.

368
00:36:53,412 --> 00:36:56,609
His colleague was there, too.

369
00:36:56,982 --> 00:37:00,085
But it hardly raised his spirits.

370
00:37:00,085 --> 00:37:03,522
He couldn't share their enthusiasm.

371
00:37:03,522 --> 00:37:09,324
Mai, I'm on my own.

372
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:13,198
I can't forgive them.

373
00:37:13,198 --> 00:37:15,200
Mai!

374
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,035
He couldn't see her.

375
00:37:17,035 --> 00:37:21,106
But he could feel her presence.

376
00:37:21,106 --> 00:37:26,066
He couldn't take anymore and left the bar.

377
00:37:28,981 --> 00:37:31,108
Mr. Fujita!

378
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,080
Mr. Fujita!

379
00:37:34,286 --> 00:37:35,721
Reiko...

380
00:37:35,721 --> 00:37:38,256
I thought that was you.

381
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,424
He bumped

382
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:45,056
into Reiko, an old flame.

383
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:51,837
Out of regret or loneliness...

384
00:37:51,837 --> 00:37:57,036
He drunk enough to forget his pain.

385
00:38:05,817 --> 00:38:10,489
When he awoke he found himself in the hotel.

386
00:38:10,489 --> 00:38:12,480
Oh, no!

387
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:17,396
Hello...

388
00:38:17,396 --> 00:38:21,423
Could you wait a little?

389
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:25,228
Oh, no.

390
00:38:26,605 --> 00:38:28,129
Mai?

391
00:38:30,342 --> 00:38:33,834
What am I doing here?

392
00:38:34,546 --> 00:38:37,879
Sorry to keep you waiting. Mr. Fujita?

393
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:42,586
His conscience forced him to return home.

394
00:38:44,089 --> 00:38:46,216
I'm home.

395
00:38:49,461 --> 00:38:51,063
Hello.

396
00:38:51,063 --> 00:38:53,732
After my customers left the bar,

397
00:38:53,732 --> 00:38:55,834
they were in a car accident.

398
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:59,037
3 of them!

399
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:00,238
What!

400
00:39:00,238 --> 00:39:02,207
I heard...

401
00:39:02,207 --> 00:39:05,911
Mai saying I can't forgive them.

402
00:39:05,911 --> 00:39:08,980
Then, Fujita heard her...

403
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:12,284
You are dirty, Daddy.

404
00:39:12,284 --> 00:39:15,447
That was the last they heard from Mai.

405
00:39:15,487 --> 00:39:18,012
The End

406
00:39:18,557 --> 00:39:21,458
THE PROMISE

407
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:27,233
Mine went further.

408
00:39:27,233 --> 00:39:30,336
We were inseparable.

409
00:39:30,336 --> 00:39:32,972
I was so happy to see her

410
00:39:32,972 --> 00:39:35,270
that I enjoyed going visiting her.

411
00:39:37,877 --> 00:39:38,811
Granny!

412
00:39:38,811 --> 00:39:39,945
What Osamu?

413
00:39:39,945 --> 00:39:42,281
Are you going to die one day?

414
00:39:42,281 --> 00:39:45,051
Of course.

415
00:39:45,051 --> 00:39:47,119
I've never seen a ghost.

416
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,256
Can you return as a ghost for me?

417
00:39:50,256 --> 00:39:52,958
For you, I will.

418
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:55,628
I will come and see you

419
00:39:55,628 --> 00:39:56,829
Really?

420
00:39:56,829 --> 00:40:02,902
But you must promise me
not get frightened.

421
00:40:02,902 --> 00:40:05,700
I won't.

422
00:40:06,906 --> 00:40:09,275
You're my Granny.

423
00:40:09,275 --> 00:40:11,877
Promise?

424
00:40:11,877 --> 00:40:14,380
Yes.

425
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,349
I will return, you know.

426
00:40:16,349 --> 00:40:18,146
I won't get frightened.

427
00:40:19,819 --> 00:40:22,379
She died sometime ago.

428
00:40:22,588 --> 00:40:26,025
I was sad but my only consolation

429
00:40:26,025 --> 00:40:28,118
was she died without suffering.

430
00:41:09,902 --> 00:41:13,429
Were you frightened?

431
00:41:15,741 --> 00:41:18,767
I was dead scared.

432
00:41:27,353 --> 00:41:29,878
Don't be frightened.

433
00:41:32,425 --> 00:41:33,559
I was scared.

434
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:35,694
Shit! I was frightened.

435
00:41:35,694 --> 00:41:37,719
Damn!

436
00:41:38,597 --> 00:41:42,897
It was the 7th day of mourning.

437
00:41:43,769 --> 00:41:46,772
I worked out a plan.

438
00:41:46,772 --> 00:41:50,209
Her soul will return on the 49th day

439
00:41:50,209 --> 00:41:52,700
before leaving for the next world.

440
00:41:52,945 --> 00:41:55,880
I wouldn't be scared this time.

441
00:42:06,692 --> 00:42:10,526
Granny, I'll challenge you.

442
00:42:18,537 --> 00:42:20,437
Come on!

443
00:42:53,672 --> 00:42:55,162
Why?

444
00:43:11,724 --> 00:43:15,285
Granny didn't come after all.

445
00:43:17,096 --> 00:43:20,122
Her soul must have come to rest.

446
00:43:39,051 --> 00:43:42,154
Granddad!

447
00:43:42,154 --> 00:43:45,824
The neighbors!

448
00:43:45,824 --> 00:43:49,453
Did you get scared?

449
00:44:01,106 --> 00:44:03,267
She'd got me.

450
00:44:06,178 --> 00:44:09,248
Come the anniversary of her death...

451
00:44:09,248 --> 00:44:11,682
I swear I wouldn't be scared.

452
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:16,511
The End

453
00:44:16,989 --> 00:44:19,958
HE'S HOME

454
00:44:35,174 --> 00:44:37,409
2 years ago, I met her at a bar

455
00:44:37,409 --> 00:44:43,109
and I moved in.

456
00:44:44,817 --> 00:44:48,821
Her husband passed away 3 years ago.

457
00:44:48,821 --> 00:44:53,792
She lives at this apartment with her son Takeru.

458
00:44:53,792 --> 00:44:58,697
At that time, I was in debt from
the failure of my company.

459
00:44:58,697 --> 00:45:04,067
And didn't even have a place
to crash so I came here.

460
00:45:12,077 --> 00:45:14,980
I wanted to sleep next to Tomoko.

461
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:17,883
But I didn't want to sleep
in front of her ex.

462
00:45:17,883 --> 00:45:21,785
So I slept in the living room.

463
00:46:47,005 --> 00:46:49,675
It was a lantern festival.

464
00:46:49,675 --> 00:46:52,041
Her ex came back.

465
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,703
A year after from the day.

466
00:47:17,703 --> 00:47:21,036
I was sleeping with her.

467
00:48:16,595 --> 00:48:19,297
Ah... Daddy!

468
00:48:19,297 --> 00:48:21,266
Daddy!

469
00:48:21,266 --> 00:48:23,869
Are you ok?

470
00:48:23,869 --> 00:48:26,804
What is wrong?

471
00:48:49,628 --> 00:48:53,365
A year from the day...

472
00:48:53,365 --> 00:48:56,266
I am still living with her.

473
00:49:04,009 --> 00:49:06,637
Lantern festival is coming soon.

474
00:49:12,017 --> 00:49:15,009
The End

475
00:49:15,421 --> 00:49:18,322
THE BREATH OF MONONOKE

476
00:49:50,556 --> 00:49:52,854

Her head, legs and arms were cut off

481
00:50:06,472 --> 00:50:10,743
Police suspect that she could be
the latest victim of a serial killer...

482
00:50:10,743 --> 00:50:12,411
Thanks.

483
00:50:12,411 --> 00:50:13,946
Take care.

487
00:51:11,103 --> 00:51:12,271
Hello.

488
00:51:12,271 --> 00:51:14,840
I can't pick up the phone right now.

489
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,535
Please leave a message.

490
00:51:17,143 --> 00:51:19,812

A body of a young woman

496
00:53:50,362 --> 00:53:53,232
